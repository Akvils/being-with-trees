# 🦅 About

&#x20;🦅 was born in India and raised in a traditional Buddhist family. From the age of seven, they were introduced to meditation and contemplative practices rooted in nature, spending time in forests and learning traditional ways of presence, awareness, and inner discipline. They have been practising meditation and allied inner practices for over 28 years.

They hold a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering and a Master’s degree in Design and Buddhist Studies, bringing together analytical thinking, embodied experience, and contemplative understanding. Over the years, they have studied under multiple teachers and guides, learning meditation, spiritual inquiry, and embodied awareness practices across different lineages.

Alongside Eastern contemplative traditions, they have also explored Western shamanic and nature-based practices, deepening their understanding of how humans relate to land, trees, and natural intelligence. Their work integrates meditation, presence, bioenergetic awareness, and nature-based practices into guided forest journeys that support grounding, clarity, and psychological and spiritual well-being.

They facilitate forest and nature-connection journeys as experiential spaces, not as belief systems, inviting participants to reconnect with presence, restore balance, and rediscover their relationship with the living world.
