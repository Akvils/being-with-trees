#### Part 1: Foundation by the Tree

Sit under a tree, allowing your back to rest firmly and comfortably against its trunk.

Take a moment to truly feel this connection. Feel the specific texture of the bark against your clothing and your back. Feel the solid, unwavering presence of the earth beneath you, holding you. You are completely supported by the tree and the ground.

With this support, establish your posture. The tree is now your ally. Allow it to help you keep your spine comfortably straight, without strain. Let your head balance lightly on top of your spine. Rest your hands upon your lap, letting them be heavy and still.

(Pause)

Now, bring that subtle, inner smile to your lips. A gentle uplift at the corners of your mouth. It is a smile of inner peace and acceptance.

And when you are ready, gently allow your eyes to close, shutting the door to the outer world.

(Pause)

Bring your awareness inward and upward. Gently guide your focus to the space between your eyebrows. This is your third eye, your center of observation.

You are not to strain or force it. Simply let your attention settle here, like a soft, steady light. This is the place from which you will observe the rest of the practice.

Rest here for a few moments. Simply be: supported by the tree, holding the gentle smile, with your awareness centered and settled at the third eye.

(Long pause)

#### Part 2: Awareness of the Right Hand

You are settled, with your awareness resting in the middle of your forehead.

While holding your attention at the third eye, as if looking down from that point, become aware of your right hand by your side. Split the awareness between the middle of your forehead and the right hand. You’ll feel a slight tingling sensation. When you look at your hand, your hand responds to your awareness, it responds to being watched. Notice this tingling sensation and the aliveness of your hand.

Now, become conscious of your first finger. Feel into it from your point of observation. Be aware of the aliveness within it, the subtle energy, the flow of blood. The finger answers your awareness. That tingle you may feel is energy from the mind converting into your body. If you feel that tingle, that response, say quietly to yourself, “Yes.”

If so, as soon as you have acknowledged it, go to the second finger. Do the same thing. From your forehead, look into the finger, feel its presence, and wait for its response. When you feel the tingle, the aliveness, say "Yes" to yourself.

Now, in the same way, move your awareness to the third finger. Observe it from your command post. When it answers your awareness with a sensation, acknowledge it with a "Yes."

And then the pinky finger. Wait for the response. Say "Yes."

And then the thumb. Be aware of it until you feel the tingle. Say "Yes."

If thoughts come in, don't be dragged by them. Notice that thoughts have come, gently acknowledge them without judgment. Let them go by moving your full attention back to the middle of your forehead, watching them pass like clouds in the sky before returning to your hand.

#### Part 3: Awareness of the Body

Now, gently allow the specific focus on your right hand to soften. Keeping your awareness anchored in the middle of your forehead, we will continue this journey of loving attention through the rest of the body. Watch your body with love, give yourself the loving attention it needs to heal.

From the middle of your forehead, guide your awareness across to your left hand.

Just as you did with the right, become conscious of your first finger. Feel into it. What sensations are present right now? Is there warmth? A coolness? A subtle pulse or vibration? There is no need to find anything special. Simply notice what is already here. The life within the finger. When you feel its presence answer your attention, acknowledge it with a quiet, inner "Yes."

Now, move to the second finger of the left hand. Gently, patiently. Feel its aliveness. Let your awareness, looking down from your forehead, bathe the finger in a kind attention. When you feel its response, say "Yes."

In the same way, move your awareness to the third finger. Observe the reality of this moment, in this finger. Whatever sensation is present, just know it. Acknowledge it with a "Yes."

And then the pinky finger. Feel its unique presence. Say "Yes."

And then the thumb. Feel the strength and aliveness within it. Say "Yes."

(Short Pause)

Now, allow your awareness to expand, feeling the entire left hand as one field of sensation. Then, feel both hands simultaneously. Alive. Vibrating with energy. Bathed in the soft light of your awareness.

(Short Pause)

Now, from your forehead, begin to move your awareness up both arms. Feel the wrists, the forearms, the elbows, the upper arms, all the way to your shoulders. Feel the volume of your arms, the muscles, the bones, the skin. Whatever sensations are present, pressure, tingling, warmth, just know them. They are as they are.

Gently guide your awareness to the top of your head. Feel the scalp, the roots of your hair.

Move your attention down to your face. Feel the forehead itself, the point from which you are watching. Feel your temples, soft and relaxed.\
Bring your awareness to your eyes, without any strain. Feel the eyelids.\
Be aware of your nose, and the gentle sensation of the air at your nostrils.\
Be aware of your mouth, your lips, your tongue, your jaw. Let any tension here melt under the warmth of your loving attention.

Guide your awareness to your neck and throat. The front, the sides, and the back of the neck.

Now, bring your attention into the torso. Feel the chest. Can you feel the subtle movement of the breath? Can you feel the gentle beating of your heart? There is so much life here.\
Move the awareness down to your solar plexus and your abdomen. Feel the softness here.

Shift your focus to your back, starting from the base of your neck, moving down between your shoulder blades, the middle back, and the lower back. Feel the whole length of your back being supported by the tree. Feel this connection as a field of sensation, pressure, warmth, solidity.

Bring your awareness to your buttocks, feeling the solid contact with the earth.\
Move your awareness into your pelvis, the hips and the genitals, with the same gentle, non-judgmental curiosity.

(Short Pause)

Now, we will travel down the legs. From your forehead, bring your full attention to the right leg.\
Feel the whole thigh, from the hip to the knee.\
Be aware of the knee joint.\
Feel the calf muscle and the shin bone.\
Be aware of the ankle.\
Now feel the entire right foot, the heel, the sole, the top of the foot, and each of the five toes. Feel it as a complete field of tingling aliveness.

And now, guide your awareness over to the left leg.\
Feel the thigh.\
The knee.\
The calf and the shin.\
The ankle.\
And now the entire left foot, the heel, the sole, the top, and all five toes.

(Long Pause)

#### Part 4: The Upward Journey

And now, we begin the journey back home.

Keeping your awareness anchored at the third eye, bring your focus to both of your feet simultaneously. Feel them resting on the earth.

From your observation post, begin to guide your awareness slowly upward.

Move up from your feet to your ankles.\
Feel into your calves and your shins.\
Bring your awareness up through your knees.\
Feel the volume and strength of your thighs, traveling upward to your hips.

Feel your awareness fill your entire pelvic region. The buttocks resting on the ground, the hips, the genitals.\
Let the awareness continue to travel upward into your torso.\
Feel your abdomen, soft and alive with the gentle rhythm of the breath.\
Feel your entire back, from the base of the spine all the way up to your shoulders, feeling its connection to the tree.\
Be aware of your chest and your heart center.

Now, bring your awareness to your fingertips once more. From the tips of the fingers of both hands, let your awareness travel back up.\
Through the hands and the wrists.\
Up the forearms to the elbows.\
Through the upper arms to your shoulders. Feel both arms completely, humming with life.

Let the awareness continue its journey up through your neck and your throat.

Finally, guide your awareness back up into your head. Feel your jaw, your mouth, your nose, your eyes, your temples.

And now, allow your awareness to come to rest completely, fully settled back at its source, the middle of your forehead. You have returned. Rest here for a moment, gathered and whole.

(Long Pause)

#### Part 5: Conclusion

Now, for the final step. Let go of focusing on any one part.

From your observation post at the third eye, expand your awareness to encompass your entire physical form at once. From the top of your head, down through your arms, your torso, and your legs, to the very tips of your toes.

Feel the whole body as one unified field of sensation. A single, vibrating, living organism. Breathing. Pulsing with life.

Be still and know this body. Rest in this state of full, loving awareness.
