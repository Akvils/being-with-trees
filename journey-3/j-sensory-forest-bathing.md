#### Principle

Before we begin, I want to share the principle that this journey is based on.

Nature is not separate from consciousness.\
Nature is the visible expression of source consciousness.\
The same intelligence that moves stars, seasons, and growth moves through trees, water, earth, and air.

That intelligence carries light.

Light here does not mean brightness.\
It means creative power, coherence, life force, awareness.

When we enter nature with presence, we place ourselves in direct contact with that flow.\
And something very specific begins to happen.

The more you open yourself to nature, the more light you allow in.\
As more light moves through you, your capacity to receive light increases.\
And as your capacity increases, even more light can flow.

This creates a natural spiral.\
Receiving light expands your ability to receive.\
Expansion allows deeper reception.\
And the process continues on its own, without effort.

This journey is designed to support that spiral.

At first, the connection may feel physical or emotional, grounding, calm, clarity, relief.\
As the journey deepens, perception begins to shift.\
You may start to sense awareness beyond form.\
Beyond the tree as an object.\
Beyond yourself as a separate body.

That recognition, awareness meeting awareness, is what many traditions call divinity.\
Not as belief, but as direct experience.

Along the way, psychological and spiritual benefits naturally arise:\
greater stability, openness, clarity, and integration.\
But these are not the goal.

The real purpose of this journey is alignment.\
As alignment deepens, the journey itself becomes the reward.

Nothing needs to be forced.\
Nothing needs to be achieved.\
We are simply creating the conditions for light to move more freely.

And from there, the process knows how to continue.

#### Rest

Before we do anything, we rest.

Rest here means relaxing effort.\
You do not need to improve anything or reach any state.

Allow your body to stop holding itself unnecessarily.\
Let the shoulders drop.\
Let the jaw loosen.\
Let the breath settle into its natural rhythm.

Do not control the breath.\
Just notice it.

If thoughts arise, let them pass.\
No engagement is needed.

Feel the weight of your body.\
Feel gravity supporting you.\
The ground is already doing the work.

This is an important principle of the journey:\
Relax and let go. Everything will come to you.

You do not need to reach for light.\
When the body and mind soften, light enters naturally.

We rest to step out of effort, tension, and social alertness.\
We rest to leave the world of constant doing.

Stay here for a few moments.\
Let the nervous system settle.\
Let presence arrive on its own.

Rest is the foundation.\
From rest, awareness becomes clear.

#### Presence

Presence is the faculty of thoughtless awareness. It is the state of being.\
It is thoughtless, timeless, and non-reactive awareness.\
It is not thinking, visualizing, or concentrating.\
It is awareness without mental commentary.

In presence, there is no analysis, no memory, no anticipation.\
There is only direct experience, as it is, right now.

Presence is not something you do.\
It is what remains when you stop doing.

This distinction matters because presence is what deepens during the journey.\
Practices do not deepen on their own; presence does.

As the journey continues, what changes is not the content of experience, but the stability of presence itself.\
The more presence is recognized, the more naturally it expands and becomes continuous.

#### Intention

Set a simple intention for this journey.

The intention is to learn how to connect with trees and nature,\
to feel more grounded, more present, and more positive.

You are not trying to fix anything.\
You are not trying to achieve a special state.

You are simply opening yourself to receive.\
\
Let this intention be light, not forced.\
Hold it gently, and then allow the journey to unfold.
