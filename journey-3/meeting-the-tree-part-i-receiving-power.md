Find a tree where you can sit quietly for at least half an hour without being disturbed.\
Oak, ash, birch, or pine are best suited for this, as they have a strong and balanced aura.\
Sensing the tree’s aura and receiving power from it will help you strengthen your own.

Once you’ve learned to relax, you’ll notice your perception becoming sharper.\
The consciousness in your aura expands, allowing you to sense more of the life around you.\
We begin this learning with a tree, for in many cultures, trees have been among the greatest and most powerful helpers of humankind.

Practising relaxation and rhythmic breathing over time brings many benefits:\
You become calmer, more resilient in the face of everyday stress, more attentive, and better able to concentrate.

When you find your tree, speak to it, either aloud or in your mind.\
Words are your means of communication; fill them with feeling.\
Tell the tree that you admire its beauty, that you like it, that you are its friend.\
Tell it that you wish to sense its aura.\
Ask the tree to show it to you, and do not worry about what others might think.

If one tree feels uncomfortable, simply move to another and try again.\
When you sense that a tree is benevolent toward you, sit beneath it with your back against the trunk and relax.\
Use the same relaxation and rhythmic breathing techniques you’ve learned earlier.\
When you feel at ease, focus on sensing the tree’s aura and receiving its energy.\
There’s no need to strain; stay soft, open, and patient.

You may quietly say:\
“Please help me sense your aura and share your energy.”\
Then simply notice what happens.

As you relax, you may feel warmth spreading through your body, pleasant, comforting, almost as if you were floating in warm water.\
As your aura merges with the tree’s, a gentle, soothing sensation arises.\
You might sense a faint greenish glow around you, or a kind of soft vibration.\
Sometimes, your vision may open enough to glimpse your own aura blending with the tree’s.\
Give it time. Don’t rush, and don’t be discouraged if nothing seems to happen right away.\
Stay by the tree for at least half an hour. If your first attempt feels unclear, return another day.

Be calm, consistent, and attentive, and you will succeed.\
Thank the tree before you leave. Bring some flour, sugar, incense, finely ground sage, or other earthy herbs and sprinkle them around the tree trunk to express your gratitude.

In order to do better in nature, you should get yourself a small bag in which you can carry offerings. Exchanging energies with nature is an important principle. Nothing is taken from nature without giving in return. For too long, humanity has only taken. If you want nature’s beings to trust you and work with you, show them that your relationship is based on mutual respect and give-and-take, not exploitation.

Now that you have found your tree and felt its presence, sit beneath it.\
Let its stillness enter you. Breathe, relax, and begin your meditation under its protection.\
The tree will hold you as you go inward.
