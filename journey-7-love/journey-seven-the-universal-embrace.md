<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/breathtaking_alla_prima_oil_pa copy 2.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Introduction

Having learned to secure your inner world, you have earned the safety required to open it completely.

This journey is an invitation to open your heart to the reality that is already here: you are, at this very moment, deeply and completely loved and held by existence itself.

Love is not a transactional emotion; something we must chase, earn, or attract from a single, specific source. It is the very fabric of reality that holds the universe together, the air we breathe, the ground that supports us. We do not need to find it; we only need to learn how to perceive it and become it.

To do this, we will use a powerful key. We will first learn to generate the potent, specific feeling of being adored, and then use that feeling not as an end in itself, but as a lens—a lens through which we can finally see that this same intense love is radiating toward us from everything, at all times.

Prepare to see the world not as a neutral place, but as a living, loving presence that has been waiting for you to notice its embrace.

Let us begin.

#### Part 1: The Invitation of the Loving Ally

Begin your journey by walking. Let your heart, not your eyes, guide you.

For this journey, we are not seeking the same immense, protective strength we sought for our shadow work. Today, we seek a different quality. Look for a tree that feels gentle, nurturing, and welcoming. You will know it when you feel it. It might be a tree with soft, drooping leaves, or one whose bark seems to have a gentle texture, or simply one that radiates a feeling of quiet kindness.

When you have found this loving friend, approach it softly. Sit down, allowing your back to rest against its trunk. Place your hands on its bark and feel the calm, life-giving energy flowing within it.

Close your eyes. Let us ask for its help in this special work. Speak these words, either in a whisper or clearly in your heart:

"Gentle friend, I have come to you today to learn how to perceive the love that is everywhere.

I ask for your help. Please, help me to open my own heart so that I can feel the universal love that flows through all things, the love that flows through you.

Lend me your gentle presence, and share with me the secret of how to simply be, and in that being, to both give and receive love without effort."

After you have made your request, be still.

Listen with your heart. The tree's acceptance will not be a thought, but a feeling. You may feel a gentle warmth spreading through your back, a sense of your own heart-space softening and expanding, or simply a profound wave of peace that feels like a soft, silent embrace.

Rest in this feeling. The alliance is made. The space of the heart is now open and held. You are ready to begin the core practice.

#### Part 2: The Core Practice (Stage 1) - Seeding the Feeling

Remain seated, held in the safe embrace of your loving guardian. Let us begin the process of creating our seed of love.

**Step 1: The Heart Connection**

Take a slow, deep breath in… and breathe out. Relax. Watch your inner sky.

Set this intention clearly in your heart: This meditation will help you to feel more love than ever before. As you feel this love grow, that energy will ripple outward, allowing you to perceive the immense love that already exists in your life.

* Now, bring your full attention to the energy in your heart. You can place your hands over your heart now, and just rest your awareness in the center of your chest.
* As you do so, breathe deeply. Know that with every breath you take, you will feel more and more connected to your heart, more and more connected to who you really are.
* Take a deep breath in, and as you do, feel the energy inside your heart.
* Now, breathe out, and feel the energy in your heart center getting warmer and warmer.

**Step 2: You Are Whole and Complete**

Understand this fundamental truth: You are already whole and complete. You have value simply by being you.

What you feel in your heart is reflected in your life. The more you tap in to this feeling of love, the more you are tapping into the love that you naturally are.

Silently, repeat this to yourself: "I am whole and complete."

**Step 3: Planting the Seed**

* Imagine that there is a tiny seed of light in your hands right now. This is a seed of love.
* Set the intention that this seed will awaken you to the boundless love that is already here.
* Look at this seed of light in your hands, and now, imagine placing it directly into your heart center.
* As you imagine this seed entering your heart, feel the warmth in your chest begin to grow. Feel this energy expanding, a tiny sun coming to life within you.

**Step 4: Awakening the Seed**

Understand that this feeling of love in your heart is not new. It has always been within you. It is always here for you to tap into whenever you want. All you have to do is remember this feeling, because this feeling is who you naturally are.

* Now, bring your awareness back to the seed of light you planted in your heart.
* Imagine that out of this seed, life is starting to grow. You can see some green poking out, a small sprout emerging.
* As this sprout grows, feel the energy in your heart expanding with it. Feel into this growing emotion. This is you.

Now, to help this seed grow even more, we will water it with a memory.

* Think of a time in your past when you felt deeply connected to this feeling of love. It can be romantic but it doesn’t have to be.
* Maybe it's a memory of being with someone you care about. Maybe it's a memory of laughing with good friends. Maybe it's a moment of profound peace you felt alone in nature.
* Whatever this situation is, choose one memory now.
* Bring it into focus. Imagine it as if you are there right now, looking through your own eyes. See the details, hear the sounds, and most importantly, feel the emotion of that moment.

**Step 5: Amplifying the Memory**

You are now inside this cherished memory, looking through your own eyes. Let's make it even more real.

* What colors do you see? Look at the colors around you in this memory. Now, imagine them becoming brighter, more vibrant. Turn up the saturation.
* What sounds do you hear? Listen to the sounds of this moment. Now, imagine them becoming louder and clearer, as if you've turned up the volume.
* What else do you notice? Pay attention to the details of your environment. What is the temperature of the air around you?

As you amplify all of these sensory details, bring your awareness back to your heart center. Focus on what you felt then, and what you are feeling now as you relive it. That feeling of love.

Know that you are now more connected to your heart than ever before. Your heart has its own intelligence; it is constantly intending to communicate with you. In this heightened state, open yourself up to any message your heart may have for you right now. Be still and listen.

**Step 6: Asking the Heart's Message**

Now, in this deeply connected state, ask your heart a direct question. Silently ask:

"What message does my heart have for me right now?"

Be still and listen for an answer. It may come as a word, an image, or a simple feeling.

Now, ask a second, more specific question:

"Is there any message my heart has for me right now about how to open myself to the love that is all around me?"

Listen again. Trust whatever comes.

**Step 7: Magnifying the Seed Feeling**

Whatever feeling is in your heart right now, gratitude, peace, joy, put your full awareness on it.

Now, imagine you can magnify that feeling times ten. Feel that warm, loving energy in your heart center becoming intensely powerful.

See this energy as a vibrant, toroidal field, like a donut shape, flowing out from your heart, looping around your body, and returning to your heart again. This powerful field of love is now expanding much further beyond your body.

This powerful energy field is the lens that will allow you to perceive more love in the world than you have ever felt before.

Hold this intense, magnified feeling.

**Step 8: Affirmations for Universal Love**

Now, with this magnified field of love radiating from you, let us anchor this new reality with powerful truths. Repeat these affirmations silently to yourself, and feel their truth in your heart.

* I am whole and complete.
* I am love.
* I am that which I seek.
* The love I wish to perceive is already being offered to me.
* I am grateful for the love that is already present in my life.
* The more I focus on this feeling in my heart, the more I perceive love in the world around me.
* I trust the universe to reveal its love to me in every moment.
* My only job is to feel this love in my heart, and in doing so, I open my eyes to the love that is everywhere.
* Today, I will experience more love than ever before because I am choosing to see it.
* I am now embodying the true love that I am.

Take a deep breath and let these truths settle into every cell of your being. The seed of love you planted has now blossomed into a powerful lens of perception.

The meditation to create the seed feeling is now complete. We are ready to use this lens.

#### Part 3: The Core Practice (Stage 2) - The Great Expansion

Keep your eyes closed. Continue to hold that powerful, radiant field of love you have generated. Feel its warmth, its safety, its joy.

Now, understand a profound secret. This incredible feeling you have created is not a fantasy. It is your first clear perception of the truth. The love you felt from the imagined beloved was so powerful because it was a focused sample of the love that all of existence feels for you, right now.

It was the universe, using a human face to finally get your attention.

Let us begin the expansion.

**Feel the Tree:**

* Without letting go of that feeling, bring your awareness to the trunk of the tree at your back. Can you feel that same adoration, that same profound acceptance, radiating from your guardian? It has been holding you with this love the entire time. Feel its love now.

**Feel the Earth:**

* Now, expand your awareness downward. Feel the ground beneath you. Can you feel the same profound safety, the same unconditional support, coming up from the earth? It is holding you, just as you imagined being held in that perfect embrace. It has never once let you go. Feel its love now.

**Feel the Air and the Sun:**

* Bring your awareness to the air touching your skin, the warmth of the sun on your face. Can you feel the same gentle caress, the same joyful lightness, in the breeze? The sun has been pouring its light and warmth upon you, asking nothing in return, for your entire life. This is love. Feel it now.

**Feel Everything:**

* Now, let the focus dissolve. Feel everything at once. The tree, the earth, the air, the sun, the sounds of the forest, feel it all as one single, immense field of love directed entirely at you.

This is the truth of your existence. You are not a separate being, walking through a neutral world. You are a cherished part of a living, loving universe. You are deeply and completely held.

Rest in this knowing. Let the reality of this universal embrace wash over you. There is nothing to do but receive it.

#### Part 4: The Invitation of Universal Reception

Stay seated for just a moment longer. Feel the universal love holding you, the tree supporting you, the earth beneath you.

Now, gently bring your awareness back to your immediate surroundings. When you are ready, slowly rise to your feet.

Begin to walk, with no particular destination in mind. As you walk, let this profound truth, be the focus of your meditation:

When you look at a flower...\
When you look at a stream...\
When you look at another person...

Understand that it is the entire energy of the cosmos looking back at you through those eyes. It is the universe, seeing itself.

And when you look at them, it is that very same cosmic energy, that same universal intelligence, looking out through your eyes.

In that moment of seeing, the universe is falling in love with itself. The love you are feeling is the love of Creation, for Creation, happening through you.

Your practice is now simple.

As you walk, continue to radiate that powerful, golden feeling of love from your heart. Let it pour out of you with every step.

Feel it for the path that supports your feet. Feel it for the trees that watch you pass. Feel it for the sky that stretches above you. If you encounter another person, silently radiate it to them, recognizing the universe looking back at you through their eyes.

You are no longer just a person taking a walk. You are Love Itself, moving through the world, recognizing itself everywhere it looks. Continue this radiant walk for as long as you wish.

#### The Path Forward

You have learned to see with the eyes of your heart. You have discovered that the love you once sought from a single person is, in fact, radiating toward you from every direction, at all times. You have experienced the profound truth that the universe is not a neutral or hostile place, but a living, loving presence that is fundamentally, unconditionally in love with you.

This perception is the key to the ultimate state of being.

The next journey is Ascension, where we will leave this realm, meet our essential self, and see that, the Source, in everything and everyone.
