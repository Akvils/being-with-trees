#### Part 1: Foundation

Find your comfortable and stable posture. Sit with your back straight but not rigid. Rest your hands in your lap.

Bring a subtle, inner smile to your lips and gently close your eyes.

Take a few deep, settling breaths. With each exhale, let go of the day and arrive fully in this present moment.

Take your awareness between the middle of your eyebrows. Watch the space, the inner sky in the middle of your forehead.

Now as if you’re watching through the middle of your forehead. Watch your breath.

Bring your awareness to the very tip of your nose.\
Watch the breath as it goes in and as it comes out. In and out.\
Notice that it’s going through the nostrils, the two holes in your nose. Notice that they are hollow. There is this space, this emptiness in your nose where the breathing is happening.\
Rest your attention here for a moment. Notice that space.

(Pause)

#### Part 2: The Head as Space

Now, move your awareness into your mouth. Notice that the mouth is hollow. There is a vast space in which your tongue, jaw, and teeth exist. Be aware of that space.

Bring your attention to your teeth. Watch all your teeth, above and below. Notice that there is space inside them. They are not as solid as they seem. Be aware of that space.

Now focus on your tongue. It might look solid, but it is full of pores. Feel its texture and be aware that the tongue is not solid, but is permeated with space. It is like a sponge that is mostly empty. Be aware of that space.

Gently move your awareness to your left eyeball. Go inside the eyeball and notice that it is hollow. Like a ball, it has a shell, but inside there is just space.\
Now move to the right eyeball and notice that it is empty from the inside as well. Be aware of the vast space inside both of your eyeballs.

Guide your awareness into your brain. You know its shape, its size, the two lobes. Notice that there is space between the two lobes. Notice that there is space within the countless folds of the brain. It is not a solid mass. It is made of brain cells, and there is immense space between them. Be aware that most of what you call the brain is actually empty space, in which the brain cells operate.

(Long Pause)

Now, be aware of your left ear. It’s a curved sheet with a hole in it. Notice that inside the hole there is space, and all around the hole there is space. This space makes the ear function.\
Move to your right ear and notice the hole and the space within and around it.

Bring your awareness to your entire skull. It is the structure in which these organs reside. It is hollow. Feel the space inside it, the jaw sockets, the eye sockets. Your face is filled with space. It is mostly empty.

(Pause)

#### Part 3: The Torso as Space

Let your awareness travel down into your neck. There is space in your throat from where you speak and swallow. Around it are hollow tubes of various sizes. There is space between these tubes. Your neck is empty.

Come to your chest. Bring your awareness to the left side of your chest. It is made of strands of muscle, and there is a lot of space between these strands. The chest is so hollow.\
Go to the right side of the chest and notice the same. It is made of muscles, but it is filled with space.

Within your chest is your heart. It’s breathing. Pumping blood to the body. The heart has compartments to let the blood flow in and out. The heart is full of empty space. Notice that.

Go a level deeper and you will sense the ribcage. It is made of bones with a lot of space between them. These bones themselves are hollow, with space inside them.\
This cage holds your lungs. Become aware of your left lung. It is like a sponge. That is what allows it to breathe. It is a container for air, so it is almost entirely hollow. Full of space. It is empty.\
Notice this for the right lung as well. A sponge with pores. It is empty. There is so much space within it.

(Long Pause)

Move your awareness down and notice your stomach. The stomach is a huge, empty ball designed to hold food. Notice the empty space inside your stomach.

Move below and notice the large intestines. Even where digested food is, it is like a small pipe within a vast space. Notice this space.\
\
The large intestines hold the small intestines. A long pipe folded into a small area. It has a thin layer and is filled with space. It is empty. Notice this space.

Bring your awareness to your genitals. They are hollow organs, composed of tubes and pipes. Notice the space within your genitals.

Notice your hipbone, the base that holds your body. It is filled with holes and empty spaces.\
Be aware of the anus. It is hollow. There is a space in it that moves back to the large intestine. Notice this space.

(Long Pause)

#### Part 4: The Limbs and Skin as Space

Now we will explore the limbs.

Move your awareness to your left shoulder. There are muscles with a lot of space inside them. There are small bones with space between and inside them. Notice that space. The shoulder is empty.\
\
Notice the space in the joint connecting the shoulder and the arm.\
The bone in the left arm is hollow. Around it are strands of muscle with space inside them. The elbow joint has space in it. The forearm bone is empty, and so are the muscles around it. The wrist is full of space. Go inside your left palm and notice the space between the joints of the small bones, and inside and around them. Your left hand is empty.

(Pause)

Now, move your awareness to your right shoulder. Feel the muscles with space inside them, the bones with space between and inside them. The shoulder is empty.\
Notice the space in the joint.\
The bone in the right arm is hollow. The elbow joint has space in it. The forearm is empty. The wrist is full of space. Go inside your right palm. Notice the space between the joints and bones. Your right hand is empty.

(Pause)

Now, move to your left thigh. The thigh is made of muscles with a lot of space between them. At the center is the bone, and the bone is empty.\
There is space in the knee joint. Below, the calf is a muscle with empty space, and the bone is empty.\
Notice your left ankle. It is empty. There is space between your leg and your foot.\
Move to the left foot. It is empty. The bones are small with a lot of space between them.\
The big toe is empty. The bone is empty. Move to the other toes. Notice they are empty. The second toe, the third, the fourth, and even the small toe has space inside it. Your left leg is full of space. It is empty.

(Pause)

Now, move to your right thigh. It is made of muscles with space between them. The bone at the center is empty.\
There is space in the knee joint, the calf, and the bone below it.\
Notice your right ankle. It is empty.\
Move to the right foot. It is empty, full of space between the small bones.\
The big toe is empty. The second toe is empty. The third, the fourth, and the small toe. Your right leg is empty. It is full of space.

(Pause)

Finally, bring your awareness to your entire body, covered in skin. From top to bottom, there is flesh, made of small molecules. There is a lot of space between these molecules. The skin looks solid, but now notice that it is empty. It is full of space like a fish net. Small cells are occupying a vast space to give you an illusion of solidity.

Go inside the body, it is full of space.&#x20;

Now notice the space two inches outside your skin.

Come out more, extend that awareness, there is space everywhere. On every level, there is space. It is just space, with a small mass occupying that space.

Notice this space. Stay with it.

(Long, Deep Silence)

#### Part 5: The Flip - The Wisdom of Emptiness

We have been taught that the body is us and that space is nothing. But we have just seen that the space is vast. Everything is inside it, while what we call the body is almost nothing. It’s empty. It’s an illusion that the skin is a solid outline that separates us form rest of the world.

What you think of as your solid body is empty, while the emptiness is full. It is everywhere. That is what is holding the body. It is the intelligence that created it, is sustaining it, and will one day leave it and let the body drop.

This space is you.

You are not the body. How can you be the body? You just noticed all of it, inside and out. How can you be something that you notice? You notice things that are not you.

You are what you are. Notice this space. Be this space.

You are that in which all of this shows up.

(Long, Deep Silence)

#### Part 6: The Return

Now… slowly… gently… let the focused awareness begin to soften.

Let the distinction between body and space dissolve into a simple feeling of presence.

Bring your awareness back to the physical sensations of this moment. Feel the weight of your body on the surface beneath you. Feel the air on your skin. Listen to the sounds in the room, without needing to name them.

Introduce some gentle movement to your fingers and your toes.

Take a deep, nourishing breath in, and release it with a sigh.

When you feel complete, in your own time, allow your eyes to gently drift open. Look around you, and see the space in which everything appears. Know that this space is you.
