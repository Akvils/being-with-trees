### Shadow Meeting Meditation

Welcome.

Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose… and gently release it.\
Again, breathe in… hold it for a moment… and let it go completely.

Close your eyes and bring your attention inward. Feel your body supported… grounded… and safe.

Notice any tension, any heaviness… imagine it flowing out through the heels of your feet… releasing… letting go…

Bring your awareness to any tight spots in your body.\
Imagine a small ball of energy in your mind’s eye… any color you like…\
Move it to the areas that feel tense… see it melting, softening… relaxing every muscle…\
With each breath in… feel the warmth and energy…\
With each breath out… release any stress or discomfort.

Take another deep, nourishing breath… and let it go…

Now, imagine a part of you standing before you…\
Perhaps a younger version… a self that carries doubt… fear… or the feeling of being an imposter.\
See them clearly. Notice:

* What age are they?
* What are they wearing?
* How do they hold themselves?

Take a moment to just be present with them.\
Do not rush. Do not try to change them.\
Simply observe… connect… feel their presence.

Ask softly: _“What are you afraid of?”_\
Listen… notice their expression… their emotions…\
Give yourself permission to be an empathetic witness.\
You are here to nurture, not to fix.

Say quietly to them: _“I see you. I am here with you. I breathe with you.”_

Take a slow, deep breath together… and release.\
Feel their relief… their sense of being held… their safety.

Now, imagine wrapping them in a bubble of love, protection, and compassion…\
See the love gently infusing into them… transforming them…\
Watch as they become a glowing ball of energy… moving softly into your heart…

Take a long, deep breath in… feel this love spinning, expanding in your chest…\
Let it fill every corner of your being.\
Exhale slowly… releasing any remaining tension.

Now, gently count down from five to one…\
With each number, think of something you are grateful for…\
Feel the energy in your heart grow with every breath:

5… gratitude for this moment…\
4… gratitude for your breath…\
3… gratitude for your body…\
2… gratitude for the love within you…\
1… gratitude for your growth… your presence… your light.

Take one final deep breath in… and let it go…\
Gently wiggle your fingers and toes…\
When you are ready, slowly open your eyes…\
Bring your awareness fully back into your body…\
Notice how you feel… calm… centered… connected.

You have met your shadow… you have held it with love… and it is now a part of your heart.
