# 💌 S: A Tree and a Boy

There was once a great tree whose roots held the earth like memory and whose branches played with the sky. When flowers bloomed, birds came from far away to drink their fragrance. When the fruits ripened, butterflies hovered in their light.

A small boy came every day to play in its shade. The tree loved him. It bent its branches so he could reach its fruits. It whispered songs in the wind to make him laugh. Love always bends; ego never does.

The boy would sleep under it, pluck its fruits, weave crowns of its flowers, and dance, calling himself the king of the forest. And the tree was happy, because love finds joy in giving.

But time passed. The boy grew. School began. Ambitions crept in. Friends, exams, noise, the tree waited. The seasons changed, but the boy no longer came every day.

One afternoon, after a long time, he came again. The tree trembled with joy; leaves rustled like applause.

“Come!” it said, “come, play with me!”

The young man looked at it and said, “I don’t have time for childish things anymore. I need money. I have to go to the city, build a life.”

The tree fell silent for a while, then said softly, “Take my fruits. Sell them in the market. You’ll get money.”

And he did, climbed its branches, plucked every fruit, broke the young shoots. The unripe ones fell to the ground.\
But the tree was happy. It whispered to itself, He will return.

Years passed. He didn’t.

When he finally came again, he looked older, heavier, full of plans.\
The tree said, “Come, sit, rest with me!”\
“I don’t have time,” he said, “I need a house. I need shelter for my family.”

The tree thought for a moment and said, “Cut off my branches. Build your house. You’ll be warm.”

He did. He cut the branches. Birds flew away. The tree stood naked against the wind. Yet it smiled, because love is happy even when it is broken.

Years went by. The man grew old. The tree now was only a trunk, scarred but waiting.

Then one evening, he came again. His voice was tired, his body bent.\
“I must travel far,” he said, “I need a boat to cross the sea.”

The tree said quietly, “Cut me down. Make your boat from my trunk. Sail away. Only… come back when you can.”

He cut it down. Built his boat. And left.

Now only a stump remained, a dark, round heart pressed into the soil. The rains came, moss grew, decades passed.

I once sat beside that stump. The wind whispered through the nearby grass, and I heard them say:\
“He never came back. Maybe the boat sank. Maybe he reached his shore. Maybe he forgot.\
But if someday he remembers, tell him, I have nothing left to give. Only my roots, still warm.\
If he is tired, he may rest here.”

That night I understood:\
Love gives without reason.\
Ego takes without end.\
The tree never knew it was giving; it only knew how to love.
