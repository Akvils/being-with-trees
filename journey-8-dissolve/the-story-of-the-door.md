# 💌 The Story of the Door

A man, who had spent his life in search of the Beloved, at last arrived at the door of his destination. With a heart full of hope and the fire of longing, he knocked.

From within, a voice, clear as a flawless diamond, asked:\
"Who is there?"

Filled with the pride of his long journey and the certainty of his devotion, the man replied, "It is I."

The voice replied, "In this house, there is no room for two 'I's."

And the door remained shut.

The man turned away, not in anger, but in understanding. He walked back into the wilderness of the world, but this time, his journey was inward. For years, he was polished by silence and burned by the fire of separation. He let the winds of sorrow wear away his sharp edges, and the long nights of solitude consume his name, his history, and his pride.

He fasted from his own importance until there was nothing left of the "I" that had first knocked on the door. All that remained was a quiet, empty space filled only with love for the Beloved.

One day, he found himself back at the same door, though he himself was no longer the same. He lifted his hand, now empty of any claim, and knocked again.

From within, the same clear voice asked:\
"Who is there?"

And from the ashes of the self, the man replied with all that was left of him:\
"It is You."

The door swung open.

And he found that he was not entering a house at all, but simply entering himself.
