# 💩 Journey Zero: The Walk of Shame

Every journey must begin somewhere, and this one begins in the world we have made.\
Before we can enter the forests, before we can meet the trees, we must walk through the human world and see it for what it has become.

Step outside. Walk among people. Notice what you feel.\
The streets hum with invisible noise, the weight of anxiety, lust, fear, envy, confusion. These are not just emotions; they are fields of energy. They press upon the body, the mind, the subtle being.\
Each gaze that carries judgment or desire leaves a trace; each crowd is a wave of thought and emotion. Children, still soft and open, absorb these energies easily, what we call evil eye is often just this: the impact of another’s unclean intention entering an unguarded aura.

This walk is a walk of shame, not as punishment, but as recognition.\
Feel how the world has hardened around us. Feel how we have become estranged from innocence. Notice how your breath changes, how your shoulders tense, how your heart contracts in crowds. Do not resist it; simply see it.

Then, forgive.\
Forgive the people, the noise, the wounds. Forgive yourself.\
For only through forgiveness can the healing begin.

Let this walk remind you why you are here, why these journeys matter.\
To recover the forgotten connection. To remember what it feels like to be whole.

Don't worry, after you merge with nature, you will be able to walk like that in this world as well. That's the point of all this. As one scripture says, “it takes three days”, perhaps three walks, perhaps three lifetimes, to rise again.<br>
