Each forest journey begins with **a conscious entry**. This marks the transition from ordinary movement into intentional practice, from the human world into the energetic world.

To begin, we choose two trees of the **same kind**, for example, two birch trees, two oak trees, or two pine trees, standing with a natural space between them. The trees should feel alive, stable, and clearly distinct, with enough space to pass through comfortably.

The space between these two trees is a **portal**, a gateway into the energetic forest.

We stand before this portal and **set our intention** for the journey. The intention is kept simple and sincere. It may be for healing, clarity, grounding, strength, gaining power, or any single focus we wish to work with. We do not analyse the intention or elaborate on it. We state it clearly and allow the journey to serve it.

When we are ready, we step forward with the **right foot**, placing it between the two trees as if entering the portal. This physical action marks the beginning of the journey.

From this moment on, we move with awareness, openness, and presence. We allow the forest to respond and remain receptive, without forcing or controlling the experience. **Nature serves the intention** through the journey itself.

The journey unfolds through what we notice, what we feel, and how **we are guided** moment by moment. The walk itself becomes the practice.

The first journey begins with the landscape. It is an introduction to the environment and to the practice of moving through it with awareness.
