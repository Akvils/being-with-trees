# 💪 Why This Project Matters?

A while ago, I received an email from HR titled “Your Well-Being Matters.” It said:

> Dear colleagues, today a message was noticed in our office that raises concern and may be related to a colleague's emotional well-being. We want to remind everyone that each one of us faces challenges and it's important to know that no one should have to deal with them alone. If you are feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or simply need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to reach out to the HR team, your manager, or make use of the emotional well-being support we offer. Your well-being matters to us. \
> \
> We'd like to remind you that we have additional health insurance coverage, which includes consultations with a psychiatrist, psychiatrist-psychotherapist, medical psychologist, and medical psychologist-psychotherapist, including psychotherapeutic treatment provided by these professionals. This coverage allows for up to 12 visits during the insurance period. We also encourage you to use the Headspace app, which supports emotional health, stress management, and mindfulness. \
> \
> Lastly, let's all try to be mindful of one another. If you notice that a colleague may be struggling, don't ignore it. Extend a helping hand when it's needed. Sometimes a sincere conversation can make a meaningful difference. Let's take care of ourselves and each other.

At first glance, this message sounds thoughtful and supportive, filled with professional terms, such as psychiatrist, psychotherapist, psychologist, and treatment. But if these measures truly solved the issue, then wouldn’t fewer people be struggling in the first place? The reality is that we live in a society where psychological suffering is widespread. We are, collectively, a psychologically unwell species.

Our doctors, psychotherapists, and other helpers do their best, but despite their efforts, the problem only seems to grow. As I’ve written in the manifesto, we humans today are a post-scientific civilisation: materially advanced, but psychologically underdeveloped. Our physics has progressed, yet our inner world remains fragile.

And yet, in earlier times, there were civilisations whose psychological development surpassed ours, even if their material progress did not. They discovered inner solutions that helped societies remain stable and less destructive. This project seeks to tap into that forgotten wisdom, not in a nostalgic way, but to create something that can genuinely help people today: our colleagues, our neighbours, our friends, and ourselves.

Because we are all living in a state of collective psychological sickness, and what we need is a way out.
