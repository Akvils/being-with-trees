#### Introduction

This is not a passive meditation. This is an active and powerful practice of spiritual hygiene. Over time, our energy bodies can become clogged with low-vibrational energies, the need for approval, the frustration of not being in control, fear, self-attack, and attachments. These energies obscure the clear voice of our conscience and drain our vitality.

This practice is a systematic cleanse. We will first ground ourselves deep into the earth. Then, using a powerful breathing technique, we will intentionally bring up these specific negative energies and forcibly expel them from our system. Once the cup is empty, we will then call upon the Source to fill us with high-vibrational energy, before finally establishing ourselves as a sovereign, radiant being.

This is a training. We are training the mind and the body to release negativity on command, so that we can keep our inner channel clear.

#### The Foundational Breath

The engine for this entire cleanse is a specific Tibetan breathing technique. The count is always 6-6-6.

* Breathe in deeply for a count of 6.
* Hold your breath for a count of 6.
* Breathe out powerfully for a count of 6.

We will use this breath throughout the practice to move energy.

#### Step 1: Grounding into the Earth

Before we can release, we must be grounded.

* Begin by bringing your awareness fully into your body. Not in your head. Be in your body.
* Use the 6-6-6 breath a few times to settle in. Feel the tension in your body, breathe it in, hold it, and breathe it out.
* Now, imagine your legs have energetic sprouts, or roots, growing from them, plunging deep down into the earth.
* As you breathe in, use your imagination to pull the earth's stable, grounding energy up through these roots, into your legs, and into the center of your body.
* Breathe In (1-6): Pull the energy up from the earth.
* Hold (1-6): Let it gather in your core.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Release it back down into the earth.
* Repeat this two more times, feeling yourself become more and more solid, more present, more connected to the earth.

#### Step 2: The Purge of Low Vibrations

Now we begin the cleanse. For each category, you will bring the feeling fully into your awareness, lock onto it, and use the breath to expel it.

**2a. Lack of Approval:**

* Think of anywhere you don’t have the approval you want. Someone mistreating you, talking crap on you, not appreciating you, not seeing your value. Feel the frustration of it.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that lack of approval.
* Hold (1-6): Hold it. Feel their misunderstanding, their lies, their inability to see you.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Let it all go.

**2b. Lack of Control:**

* Think of an area you wish you had mastery over, but can't control right now. The outcome is uncertain and it drives you insane.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that frustrating lack of control.
* Hold (1-6): Feel the sadness and rage about it.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Release it. Assume it's actually gone. Don't let your logic play games. Just let it go.

**2c. Lack of Safety:**

* Think of any area where you feel unsafe, unprotected, or in danger. A specific fear that is bothering you. At its core, it is a feeling of lack of safety.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that fear.
* Hold (1-6): Hold it in your body.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Let it out. Release it.

**2d. The Need to Know (Uncertainty):**

* Think of an area where you don't know what will happen. It exasperates you, frustrates you, and puts you in a negative loop in your head.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that frustrating need to know the answer.
* Hold (1-6): Accept that you don't need to know the answer right now.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Let it out. Trust that the solution will emerge when it's time.

**2e. Self-Attack:**

* Think of the mistake you made, what you should have done, how guilty or stupid you feel. The raw pain of your regrets.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that self-attack, that shame, that feeling of "not good enough."
* Hold (1-6): Become familiar with that energy. Recognize that you are using it as an excuse to be negative.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Let it go. Train yourself to release it.

**2f. Attachment:**

* Think of anything you are attached to looking a certain way: a certain house, reputation, or image that gives you negativity because you need it to be a certain way.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that clingy, needy, thirsty attachment.
* Hold (1-6): Hold that neediness.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Let out that attachment.

**2g. The Final Release:**

* Now, whatever is left, any final feeling of heaviness, density, fear, any unidentifiable BS energy, lock onto it. It doesn't need a label.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in that final bit of negativity.
* Hold (1-6): Know that it is not helping you.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Expel it completely. It is leaving your body.

#### Step 3: Infusion from the Source

The cup is now empty. It is time to fill it.

* Imagine a shimmering white ball of high-vibrational energy above your head, streaked with gold. This energy is light.
* To connect with it, you must ask. Say silently to yourself: "I ask to be connected to my higher power now."
* Now, let's give that energy a frequency by listing its qualities. Silently repeat these words to yourself, feeling their energy: "Abundant, creative, unlimited, peaceful, light, easy, fun, playful, expansive, infinite, giving, loving, happy, at ease, free, liberated..."
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe that ball of pure, positive energy down into your body.
* Hold (1-6): Let it cleanse every cell.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Release your breath, but keep the energy inside you.
* Repeat this two more times, filling yourself more and more with this light.

#### Step 4: Becoming the Source

Now we will move this energy from the inside out. You are the source.

* Imagine a bubble of this positive, loving energy emanating from you, filling the city of Vilnius.
* Imagine the bubble expanding to all of Lithuania, then the Baltic states, then all of Europe. You are the source. You need nothing.
* See it expand to cover the whole Earth, then the Milky Way, then all of Creation.
* Now, use your breath to power this radiation.
* Breathe In (1-6): Breathe in the high-vibrational energy from the ball above your head.
* Hold (1-6): Let it super-charge your being.
* Breathe Out (1-6): Radiate it out into the entire universe. You are the source. You are the point of orientation.

#### Step 5: Final Integration and Stillness

* To seal the practice, declare your new state of being. Say aloud, if you can:
* "I am a giver."
* "I am expansive."
* "I am loving."
* "I am creative."
* "I am playful."
* "I am free."
* "I am awake."
* Finally, shout loudly: "Wake up!"

Now, let the energy settle. Sit in the silence you have created. If you have any questions or doubts, offer them up to the stillness and listen to the quiet, silent voice inside you.
