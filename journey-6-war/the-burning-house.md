There was an affluent man who had a large house. This house was very old and on the verge of collapsing. The halls were extremely dangerous, the bases of the pillars were rotten and disintegrating, the beams and framework were dangerously tilted, and the stairways were falling apart. The fences and walls were cracked, the plaster was peeling off, the thatched roof was falling down, the rafters and eaves were coming apart, the partitions were everywhere askew, and the whole place was covered with filth.

Five hundred people lived there. Moving around in disorderly haste and confusion were kites, owls, hawks, eagles, crows, magpies, doves, pigeons, lizards, snakes, vipers, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, newts, myriapods, ferrets, badgers, mice, rats, and other harmful creatures. The house was filled with stench, and there were places overflowing with excrement. All kinds of bugs had gathered there.

There were foxes, wolves, and vermin devouring, trampling, and gnawing on corpses, scattering bones and flesh about. A pack of dogs, forcing each other out of the way, rushed to the spot. Frightened and exhausted from hunger, they were searching everywhere for food, fighting among themselves, snatching at food, biting, snarling, and barking at each other.

This house was terrifying, corrupted to this grotesque condition. Ogres of the mountains and valleys, devouring entities and demons were everywhere, devouring human flesh. There were various poisonous insects, all kinds of harmful birds of prey, and beasts who were producing, rearing, and protecting their offspring. Predatory entities were scrabbling and fighting to devour them, and after sating themselves, evil thoughts would arise in them. The sound of their fighting was terrifying.

The cruel trickster predators were crouching on the ground, sometimes rising up a foot or two. Roaming about and pleasing themselves as they liked, they would catch the two legs of a dog, beat it until it could not bark, and, grabbing the dog’s neck with their legs, terrify it for their own amusement. There were also other demons living there with large bodies, naked, dark, and gaunt. They were screaming horrifying howls, crying out while searching for food.

Other demons were there, some with needlelike throats, while others had necks like a cow’s head; some had those of human flesh-eaters or dog-devourers. Their hair was disheveled like rank weeds, and they were destructive and malicious. Driven by hunger and thirst, they were crying and scurrying about. Territorial parasitic predators, hungry ghosts, and various malicious birds and beasts were peering out of the windows and running frantically in all directions, driven by hunger.

In this house, with its immeasurable terrors, there were many such horrendous things as these.

Now this man came out of the house. Soon after, the house suddenly burst into flames behind him. The fire instantly spread in all directions. The frame, beams, rafters, and pillars exploded and, shaking, split and crashed, while the fences and walls collapsed. All the demons screamed out loudly. The hawks, eagles, other birds, and cruel trickster demons, panicked and terrified, could not get out. Malicious beasts and poisonous insects concealed themselves in holes.

There were also scavenger demons dwelling there who were chased by the flames. They were tearing at each other, drinking blood and eating flesh. A horde of vermin had already died off, and the large malicious beasts raced to devour them, while the smoke of the stench flowed and filled everywhere. As the centipedes, millipedes, and poisonous snakes rushed, burning, out of their holes, the trickster predators devoured them one after another. The hungry ghosts, with their hair on fire, ravenous, thirsty, and suffering from the heat, frantically scurried about.

In this way, the house was extremely terrifying, with poison and fire, and disasters more than one.

Then the owner, who was standing outside the entrance of the house, heard someone say that just a moment ago, in the midst of their play, his children had entered this house. Being young and ignorant, they were attached to playing games. Hearing this, the affluent man was startled and went into the burning house to save them from the disaster of the fire.

As he thought fit, he warned the children and explained the various dangers. The fire was raging everywhere. There were endless horrors, one right after another. There were poisonous snakes, lizards, vipers, predatory entities, cruel trickster demons, vermin, foxes, dogs, hawks, eagles, kites, owls, and centipedes, all acutely suffering from hunger and thirst and all extremely terrifying. These horrors were difficult to deal with, how much more so the conflagration.

But the children, being ignorant, would not listen to their father’s warning. Still attached to their games, they kept right on playing.

Thereupon, the affluent man thought that his children, by doing this, increased his distress. There was nothing to enjoy now in this house. Nevertheless, his children, who were absorbed in play, would not accept his instructions and so would be hurt by the fire. Then he immediately thought that he should tactfully advise his children. He said that he had a variety of unusual toys, such as fine carts adorned with beautiful toys. They were just outside the gate. He called to the children to come out of the house. He said he had these carts made for them and that they could play with them as they liked.

Hearing about these carts, the children immediately started to push each other out of the way to get out of the house. Arriving at an open area, they escaped from the disaster.

The affluent man, seeing that his children had escaped from the burning house and were standing at the crossroads, was at ease. Then he joyously said that now he was happy. It was extremely difficult to raise these children. Foolish and ignorant, they couldn’t see the dangers of the house full of various poisonous insects, terrifying ogres from mountains and valleys, and a raging fire that broke out in all directions. In spite of this, these children were attached to playing their games. But by causing them to escape from the disaster, he had saved them. Therefore, he said, he now felt at ease.

People are deeply attached to worldly pleasures, their games and have no wisdom. There is no peace in the world, just like in the burning house, which is full of various suffering and which is extremely terrifying. The burning house is hardly a metaphor. Yet people can't see it.
