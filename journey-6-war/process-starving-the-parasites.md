# 👺 Process: Starving the Parasites

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Introduction

This is a process for reclaiming your personal energy from seven specific types of parasitic, non-physical entities. Their sole function is to feed on your core life force. They achieve this by projecting negative thoughts and emotions into your mind, provoking you into a reaction. When you express intense negative emotions like rage, despair, or fear, you generate the specific "food" they consume.

Their power is in their anonymity. Once you see them clearly, understand their specific tactics, and learn the protocols for their removal, their control over you begins to crumble.

#### The Mechanics of Control

These entities view Earth as a prize because humans possess an exceptional emotional range. They operate through energetic attachment, creating "implants" or "feeding tubes" in your energy field, often connected to a specific energy centre. This allows them to:

* Insert impulses that you mistake for your own thoughts.
* Amplify negative emotions to generate more potent energy.
* Harvest this emotional energy without your conscious awareness.

For millennia, most spiritual traditions have made a critical error: they treated these forces as internal psychological flaws (like the "Seven Deadly Sins") rather than as external parasitic beings. This misdiagnosis has allowed these entities to maintain their influence. By understanding them as external, you can finally revoke your consent and remove them.

**Your First Task: Identify Your Primary Attachment**

You are likely influenced by several of these entities, but one is always dominant. This is your primary attachment. As you read the descriptions that follow, pay close attention to your gut reaction.

* Which one triggers the strongest feeling of discomfort?
* Which one do you immediately want to dismiss or rationalize away?

That feeling of resistance is the entity attempting to remain hidden. That is your primary attachment, and that is where you must begin your work.

#### How This Guide Is Structured

To do this, our process for each of the seven entities is simple and direct.

First, we will start by defining the entity, giving you a clear picture of what it is and the negative state it specializes in creating.

Next, we will go through the specific symptoms, a checklist of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, so you can accurately identify its presence in your own life.

And finally, we will move into the removal process itself: a direct, step-by-step guided meditation. I will walk you through how to visualize the entity, how to speak the words that banish it, and how to see it being removed from your field for good.

#### The First Entity: The Entity of Pride

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of the elevated ego in all its forms. Its core function is to make you feel separate from and superior to others, feeding on the energy this sense of division creates.

It operates by taking a genuine strength or achievement, whether spiritual awakening, intellectual insight, professional success, or moral conviction, and poisoning it with arrogance. It whispers: "You are better. You are more advanced. You are more righteous." This tactic isolates you from true connection, blocks you from humility, and ultimately stops your growth, because a mind that believes it has already arrived cannot learn anything new.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these more distinct patterns:

* **The Superiority Complex**: A persistent, internal feeling that you are fundamentally better, smarter, or more "aware" than most people. This manifests as a quiet disdain or pity for those you deem "below" you.
* **The "Rightness" Addiction**: An obsessive need to win arguments and prove your point in discussions. You experience being wrong as a personal attack, so you defend your position fiercely, often at the expense of truth or connection.
* **A Zero-Sum Mindset**: You experience the success of others as a personal threat or a slight against you. Conversely, you feel a secret, dark satisfaction when people you envy fail or suffer a setback.
* **Achievement as Identity**: You are driven to collect accomplishments, wealth, or even spiritual knowledge not for their intrinsic value, but primarily to use them as evidence of your superior status in a silent competition.
* **Condescending Impatience**: A quickness to feel irritation or frustration when dealing with people you perceive as "slower" or less competent, whether you're in a spiritual discussion, a team meeting, or a checkout line.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, I want you to bring to mind a time you felt superior for any reason, your intelligence, your success, your moral standing, or your spiritual insights. Recall that subtle, secret satisfaction of feeling you were better, smarter, or more "aware" than someone else.

Do not judge yourself. Simply observe the feeling. Feel that small, hard knot of pride in your chest or your head. Acknowledge the feeling of being separate and elevated. This feeling is the signature of the entity. You are learning to recognize its frequency.

Now, bring your awareness to the top of your head, your crown and to the space between your eyebrows, your third eye. Visualize this entity as a serpent coiled tightly around these centers of higher consciousness and perception. Feel its cold pressure, the way it distorts your vision and whispers thoughts of superiority that you mistake for your own.

From a place of radical, honest self-assessment, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the calm authority of one who is no longer interested in the illusion of status. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Lucifuge, I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have ever obtained from me through pride and superiority.**_\
_**You have no power over a humble heart, and I choose humility.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of the true source that is beyond all hierarchy."**_

(Pause)

As you speak these words, feel the power of authentic humility rising from your heart. It is not weakness; it is a profound strength. Visualize this humble strength as a simple, warm, earthy light.

See the serpent recoil from it, unable to tolerate this frequency. Watch as its form wavers, thins, and dissolves completely into harmless smoke, blown away by the clarity of your intention. Your crown and third eye are now clear.

Feel the clean, open space at the top of your head. Feel the release of tension that comes from no longer needing to be "special" or "right." In place of pride, feel a sense of profound connection to all of humanity, recognizing the value and unique journey of every single person. This feeling of humble connection is your new shield.

You may notice resistance or a final surge of thoughts defending your specialness. Recognize this as the entity fighting. Do not engage. Simply return your focus to the feeling of humility and your shared connection with all. Continue this practice daily until those thoughts cease.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of clean, connected wisdom with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Second Entity: The Entity of Scarcity

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of greed and scarcity consciousness. Its core tactic is to infect you with the frequency of "never enough," convincing you that your self-worth is determined by your net worth. It feeds on the constant anxiety, envy, and dissatisfaction generated by this mindset, keeping you trapped in a cycle of endless accumulation that never brings peace.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these distinct patterns:

* **Your Worth is Your Net Worth**: Your internal sense of value is directly tied to your bank account. Financial gains make you feel temporarily "better" as a person, while losses feel like a deep personal failure.
* **Happiness is Always in the Future**: You consistently postpone joy and relaxation, telling yourself "I'll be happy when I reach X financial goal." Happiness is always a future event, pending a financial condition you have not yet met.
* **Chronic Financial Anxiety**: You feel a persistent, low-grade (or high-grade) anxiety about money, even when your fundamental needs for food and shelter are securely met. You constantly worry about losing what you have or not getting more.
* **The Material Comparison Trap**: You habitually compare your possessions, lifestyle, and income to others, which almost always leaves you feeling inadequate, envious, or like you are "falling behind" in life.
* **Life is Sacrificed for Income**: You are actively pursuing money at the direct expense of your relationships, your physical health, your mental well-being, or your spiritual development. The "hustle" has become more important than your own life.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, bring to mind the feeling of financial anxiety. That tight knot in your stomach when thinking about bills or your bank account. Feel the persistent belief that if you just had more, you could finally be happy.

Acknowledge the impulse to compare, the sting of envy, the feeling of being "not enough." Do not judge this feeling. Simply see it for what it is: the signature of an external entity that feeds on the fear of scarcity. It is a program you are running, and you can choose to stop it.

Now, bring your awareness to your solar plexus, the area of your stomach where your sense of self-worth resides. Visualize this entity as a dense, greedy creature attached to this energy center, its tentacles siphoning your power and injecting feelings of inadequacy and fear. See how it keeps this area in a state of chronic tension.

From a place of unshakable inner value that has nothing to do with money, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of one who knows that the universe is infinitely abundant. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Mammon, I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have ever obtained through my fear of scarcity.**_\
_**The universe is infinitely abundant and my worth is not determined by my wealth.**_\
_**You have no power over a consciousness rooted in divine abundance.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of the source that provides all things."**_

(Pause)

As you speak, feel a brilliant, liquid golden light, the very essence of infinite abundance, pouring down from the universe above. See it flowing directly into your solar plexus.

Watch as this golden light saturates the entire area. The creature cannot tolerate this frequency of true wealth. See its tentacles dissolve, its form disintegrate, and its entire being turn to dust under the radiant power of pure abundance.

Feel the tension in your stomach release. Feel the warmth and fullness spread through your core. Your solar plexus is now a shining sun of self-worth.

Rest in this feeling of fullness. It is the feeling of having enough, of being enough, right now. This is your natural state. To maintain this, practice deliberate generosity when you feel the urge to hold on tight, and consciously practice gratitude for what you already have. This gratitude makes your field uninhabitable for this entity.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of radiant self-worth and quiet gratitude with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Third Entity: The Entity of Lust and Corrupted Desire

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of lust and sexual obsession. Its function is to pervert your sacred creative energy, turning it from a source of power and connection into a tool for fragmentation and depletion. It promotes compulsive behaviors that ultimately leave you feeling empty, and it feeds on the energy produced when sacred sexuality is degraded into compulsive lust.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these progressive and escalating patterns:

* **The Compulsive Need:** You experience intense physical or mental discomfort, irritability, or anxiety if you go a short period without sexual release. The act feels less like a conscious choice and more like a desperate, recurring need you must satisfy.
* **The Escalation Effect:** You have developed a "tolerance." The fantasies or stimuli that once satisfied you now feel bland, pushing you to seek out more extreme or intense content and experiences to achieve the same level of arousal.
* **A Disconnect from Reality:** You may find that pornography consumption affects your ability to connect with a real partner, or that your relationships are founded almost entirely on sexual attraction, lacking genuine emotional compatibility and friendship.
* **The Empty Hunt:** You compulsively seek out sexual encounters, driven by a powerful urge. However, immediately after the act, you are left with a feeling of emptiness, loneliness, or even self-disgust, rather than fulfillment.
* **The Shame-Compulsion Loop:** You are caught in a painful cycle. You feel deep shame or guilt about your sexual desires or compulsive behaviors, yet you feel powerless to stop acting on them, which only leads to more shame and reinforces the cycle.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, bring to mind the feeling of compulsion. That relentless urge that drives you toward release, even when a part of you knows it will leave you feeling empty. Feel the conflict between the desire and the shame.

Do not judge this feeling. Simply acknowledge it. Recognize the compulsion as an amplified signal from an external entity that feeds on this specific energy. By seeing it clearly, you take the first step toward reclaiming your power.

Now, bring your awareness to your lower body—your root and sacral energy centers. Visualize this entity attached here, perhaps coiled around your hips or with feeding tubes connected to these centers of creative and sexual energy. See how it drains your vitality.

From a place of profound self-respect and honor for your own sacred energy, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of a creator reclaiming their power source. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Asmodeus. I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have ever obtained through my compulsive sexuality.**_\
_**My sexual energy is sacred creative force, and I reclaim it.**_\
_**You have no power over a consciousness that honours sexuality as divine.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of Source."**_

(Pause)

As you speak these words, visualize a powerful Violet Flame igniting at your root, at the base of your spine. This is the flame of transmutation and purification.

See this flame blaze intensely through your entire lower body. It does not harm you; it purifies you. Watch as it incinerates the entity's feeding tubes and burns away its attachment completely. See your own sexual energy being cleansed, returning to its natural state as a pure, potent creative force.

Rest for a moment in this feeling of purified power. Recognize that this energy is yours to direct. You can channel it upward into creative projects, into your work, into your spiritual practice.

Be aware that in the coming days, you may feel a temporary increase in sexual urges. This is the entity fighting to re-establish its food source. See this not as a failure, but as a sign that the banishment is working. During this time, your discipline is your greatest shield. Acknowledge the urge, refuse to act on it compulsively, and consciously redirect the energy.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of clean, reclaimed power with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Fourth Entity: The Entity of Paralysis

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of sloth, apathy, and the suppression of action. It specifically targets those with the potential for greatness, who have visions or missions that could improve the world. Its insidious tactic is to allow you to be productive in mundane areas of life while strategically paralyzing you in the exact areas of your true calling. It feeds on the agonizing energy of unrealized potential, the pain of knowing you are failing your purpose while feeling unable to change.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these maddeningly specific patterns:

* **The Perpetual Thinking Stage:** You have brilliant ideas that never leave your mind. You plan and dream in vivid detail but never take the first physical step to make them real.
* **The Fizzle-Out Pattern:** You start your most important projects with a powerful burst of enthusiasm, but after a few days or weeks, that energy vanishes without a trace, leaving the project abandoned.
* **Productive Procrastination:** You are highly effective at unimportant tasks, cleaning the house, organizing your inbox, as a sophisticated way to avoid the one thing you know you should be doing.
* **The Ache of Wasted Potential:** You are haunted by a constant, heavy feeling that you are wasting your life and not living up to your potential, a feeling that drains you rather than motivates you.
* **Targeted Lethargy:** You have normal energy for daily routines, but the moment you consider taking action on your true calling, a sudden and overwhelming wave of exhaustion or mental fog washes over you.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, bring to mind the project you have been avoiding. The book you haven't written, the business you haven't started, the work you know is your true calling. Feel the familiar sense of heaviness and paralysis that surrounds it. Feel the weight of your own resistance.

Acknowledge the wave of exhaustion that comes with just thinking about it. Do not judge this feeling. See it clearly as the signature of an external entity that feeds on stagnation. It is a fog, not a wall.

Now, bring your awareness to your solar plexus - your center of will, and your root - your center of action. As instructed, visualize this entity's influence as heavy, rust-colored chains wrapped around these areas. Feel the immense weight that has kept you stuck, that makes every forward movement feel impossible.

From a place of fierce commitment to your own potential, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of a creator ready to create. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Belfagore. I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have obtained through my paralysis and apathy.**_\
_**I am a being of action and creative power, and I reclaim my will.**_\
_**You have no power over a soul in motion.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of source that is pure action and creation."**_

(Pause)

As you speak, feel a brilliant golden light igniting in your core. This is the light of your own will, your creative fire.

Watch as this light radiates outwards, touching the heavy chains. See them heat up, glow, and then completely dissolve into dust under the light's power. Feel the immense weight instantly vanish from your body. Feel the lightness, the readiness, the potential for movement.

Rest for a moment in this feeling of freedom. This is your natural state: a soul in motion. To maintain this, you must break the paralysis with action. Immediately after this meditation, commit to taking one small, imperfect step toward your goal. The act of moving, no matter how small, makes your energy field incompatible with this entity. It can only exist in stagnation.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of lightness and readiness with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Fifth Entity: The Entity of Envy

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of envy, comparison, and poisoned ambition, which operates through the consciousness of "It should be me." It thrives in the age of social media, which is engineered to make you constantly compare your life with the curated highlights of others. It generates resentment and bitterness, feeding on the energy produced when you desire what someone else has while simultaneously resenting them for having it. This traps you in external comparison, preventing you from developing your own unique gifts.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these distinct patterns:

* **The Social Media Hangover:** You habitually scroll through social media and almost always log off feeling worse about your own life, accomplishments, and circumstances.
* **The Zero-Sum Game Mindset:** You perceive life as a competition. The success of others, especially peers, feels like a personal loss to you, while their failures bring you a dark, secret sense of satisfaction or relief.
* **The Diminishing Reflex:** Your immediate reaction to someone else's achievement is to mentally downplay it, attributing it to "luck," "privilege," or other factors as a way to soothe the sting of your own envy.
* **Chasing Inauthentic Goals:** You find yourself pursuing goals or material possessions not from a place of genuine desire, but because others have them and you believe attaining them will finally "even the score" or validate your worth.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, bring to mind a person or situation that triggers your envy. Allow yourself to feel that sharp, familiar pang of comparison. Feel the resentment, the bitterness, the sense of unfairness.

Do not judge yourself for this. Simply observe the feeling. See this uncomfortable energy not as a flaw in your character, but as the clear signature of an external entity. You are learning to see the hook so you can unhook yourself.

Now, bring your awareness to your heart and your throat, your centers for authentic connection and self-expression. As instructed, visualize this entity's influence as slimy tentacles wrapped around these areas, choking your ability to feel joy for others and to speak your own unique truth.

From a place of profound acceptance of your own unique path, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of a soul that refuses to be in competition with any other. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Leviathan, I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have ever obtained through comparison and envy.**_\
_**I honor the unique journey of every soul and I focus on developing my own gifts rather than coveting others.**_\
_**You have no power over a consciousness rooted in its own authentic path.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of source that is infinite and non-competitive."**_

(Pause)

As you speak, feel a healing, vibrant green light, the color of the heart, begin to radiate from the center of your chest. This is the light of self-acceptance and shared joy.

Watch as this beautiful green light touches the slimy tentacles, and see them instantly recoil and dissolve into nothingness. Feel the constriction around your heart and throat release. Feel the open, warm space that remains.

Rest for a moment in this feeling of freedom. Your path is your own, and it is sacred. To maintain this state, consciously practice celebrating the success of others. When envy arises, immediately counter it with an affirmation of appreciation. This practice of genuine happiness for others creates a frequency that this entity cannot tolerate.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of authentic peace with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Sixth Entity: The Entity of Compulsive Consumption

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of gluttony, addiction, and compulsive consumption in all its modern forms. It operates by hijacking your brain's dopamine system, training you to seek constant stimulation and novelty while making you incapable of appreciating stillness or simplicity. It feeds on the energy from the endless cycle of craving, temporary satisfaction, and renewed craving, creating a world of addicts who don't realize they're addicted because their compulsions have been normalized.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these distinct patterns in your inability to simply be:

* **The Inability to Be Still:** The moment you are unoccupied, you feel an almost unbearable impulse to reach for your phone, turn on the TV, or find some other stimulation. True silence feels uncomfortable or even threatening.
* **Mindless Consumption:** You consume things, food, media, online content, out of habit or boredom, not conscious choice. You often find yourself "snapping out" of a long scroll or finishing a snack without having enjoyed or even noticed it.
* **The Thrill of Acquisition:** You shop and buy things not because you need them, but for the temporary "high" of the purchase itself. The satisfaction quickly fades, leaving you looking for the next hit.
* **Chemical Coping:** Your default response to difficult emotions like sadness or anxiety is to immediately reach for a substance (alcohol, sugar, nicotine) to numb or alter your state, rather than allowing yourself to feel and process the emotion.
* **The All-or-Nothing Binge:** You find moderation nearly impossible. Once you start consuming something pleasurable, a TV series, a bag of chips, you feel a powerful compulsion to continue until you are completely saturated or exhausted.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, bring to mind the feeling of craving. The restless, anxious energy that arises when you are bored or still. The impulse that says "I need something." Feel the magnetic pull toward your phone, the fridge, the shopping app.

Do not judge this feeling. Simply acknowledge its power. Recognize this compulsive urge as the signature of an external entity that feeds on this cycle. By seeing it clearly, you can begin to separate yourself from it.

Now, bring your awareness to all of your senses. As instructed, visualize this entity's influence as a thick, dark, sticky film covering your eyes, your ears, and your mouth, driving you to constantly consume and preventing you from ever feeling truly satisfied.

From a place of inner wholeness that requires nothing external to be complete, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of a soul that is learning to be still. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Beelzebub, I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have ever obtained through my compulsive consumption.**_\
_**I am a being of consciousness, not a consumer, and I do not need constant stimulation to be whole.**_\
_**You have no power over a soul that has learned to be still.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of source that is complete and requires nothing."**_

(Pause)

As you speak, see a brilliant, purifying white light breaking through from the crown of your head, like the sun breaking through clouds.

Watch as this pure light touches the dark film covering your senses. See the film instantly dissolve and evaporate under its power. Feel your eyes being cleansed, able to see the beauty in simplicity. Feel your ears being cleared, able to appreciate silence. Feel your mouth being purified, able to taste food with conscious gratitude.

Rest for a moment in this feeling of clean, simple presence. You are whole and complete just as you are. To maintain this, practice sacred restraint. Deliberately create small periods of fasting, from information, from entertainment, from mindless snacking. Simply sit with whatever arises. This practice of finding peace in "less" creates an internal environment where this entity cannot survive.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of quiet wholeness with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### The Seventh Entity: The Entity of Wrath

**1. About the Entity**

This is an entity of wrath, resentment, and destructive anger. It is a master specialist that harvests the immense energy generated by rage and hatred. Its primary tactic is to prevent you from processing anger in a healthy way, pushing you into one of two traps: either you suppress anger until it becomes toxic resentment, or you express it destructively, shattering your relationships. It creates vicious cycles of rage and convinces you that your anger is righteous, so you never question the external entity amplifying and feeding on it.

**2. The Symptoms**

You may be influenced by this entity if you recognize these distinct patterns in your relationship with anger:

* **The Hair-Trigger Temper:** You have a notoriously short fuse. Seemingly minor irritations or frustrations trigger a disproportionately large and sudden eruption of rage.
* **The Grudge Holder:** You hold onto grudges for months, years, or even decades, constantly replaying past hurts and fantasizing about revenge, which keeps the emotional wound fresh and the anger potent.
* **Chronic Irritation:** You exist in a state of low-grade, constant irritation. You find fault with everyone and everything, feeling perpetually aggrieved by a world full of incompetent or annoying people.
* **The Pressure Cooker Effect:** You suppress your anger, telling yourself it's wrong to express it, until the internal pressure becomes too great and leads to a shocking, explosive outburst that seems to come from nowhere.
* **Righteous Indignation:** You feel completely and totally justified in your rage. You are unwilling to consider other perspectives or forgive, because your anger feels like a core part of your identity and a righteous sword you wield against a wrongful world.

**3. The Removal Process: A Guided Meditation**

_(Begin by finding a comfortable, upright posture. Close your eyes. Take three deep, slow breaths, centering yourself in the present moment.)_

First, I want you to bring to mind a grudge you are holding. A person or situation that fills you with that familiar, hot feeling of resentment. Feel the rightness of your anger. Feel the tension it creates in your jaw, your shoulders, your stomach.

Acknowledge this fire. Acknowledge how justified it feels. Now, see it for what it is: a powerful source of energy that is not serving you. It is food for an entity that has no interest in your well-being. By seeing it clearly, you can choose to stop feeding it.

Now, bring your awareness to your solar plexus, your center of personal power. As instructed, visualize this entity's influence as a fire burning there. Feel its heat, and feel how it creates that chronic tension in your jaw, your shoulders, and your stomach.

From a place of profound desire for your own freedom and peace, speak these words directly to it. Speak with the authority of a soul choosing to end the war. Say them aloud or with silent, focused intent.

(Pause)

_**"Azazel, I see you.**_\
_**I revoke all consent you have obtained through my anger and resentment.**_\
_**I release all grudges, all hatred, and all desire for vengeance.**_\
_**You have no power over a heart that has chosen peace.**_\
_**Leave my field now. Never come back to this body and reality ever again.**_\
_**You are banished in the name of Source that is pure love and forgiveness."**_

(Pause)

As you speak, feel a gentle, cooling blue light begin to flow down from the universe above, like a calm, healing river.

See this cooling light enter your body and flow directly to the fire in your solar plexus. Watch as it extinguishes the flames completely, replacing the burning heat with a calm resolve. Now, feel this cooling blue light spread to your jaw... to your shoulders... and to your stomach, melting away all the tension it finds.

Rest for a moment in this profound state of peace. Forgiveness is not for them; it is the act of setting yourself free. To maintain this, consciously process new anger without destructive expression, and practice forgiveness as a tool for your own liberation. This peaceful state is your new shield. It is a frequency this entity cannot inhabit.

_When you are ready, bring this feeling of cool, calm peace with you as you gently open your eyes._

#### After the Banishment: Sealing Your Field and Maintaining Sovereignty

After you have identified your primary attachment and performed the specific banishment protocol, the work is not yet finished. You must seal your energy field to prevent reattachment. This is a critical step. Removing an entity creates a temporary void in your energy field where the attachment was, and if you don't seal that space with a protective frequency, another entity will move in to fill it.

**Step 1: Daily Energetic Hygiene**

The sealing process involves several daily practices. You should engage in meditations that focus on strengthening and brightening your energy field. Regularly spend a few moments visualizing a brilliant sphere of protective white or golden light surrounding your entire body. And use sage, palo santo, or other purifying herbs to regularly clear your personal energy field and your living environment.

**Step 2: Maintain the Opposite Frequency**

This is the most important part of the work. You must consciously cultivate and maintain the positive frequency that is opposite to the entity you removed.

* If you removed the entity of **Pride**, you must actively practice **Humility**.
* If you removed the entity of **Scarcity**, you must actively practice **Abundance Consciousness**.
* If you removed the entity of **Corrupted Desire**, you must actively practice **Sacred Sexuality**.
* If you removed the entity of **Paralysis**, you must actively practice **Inspired Action**.
* If you removed the entity of **Envy**, you must actively practice **Celebrating Others**.
* If you removed the entity of **Compulsive Consumption**, you must actively practice **Conscious Restraint**.
* And if you removed the entity of **Wrath**, you must actively practice **Forgiveness**.

**Step 3: Be Vigilant Against Re-attachment**

The entity will attempt to reattach multiple times, especially in the first few weeks after removal. You must be vigilant. Any time you notice the old thought patterns and behaviors returning, you must immediately perform the full banishment protocol again. Do not hesitate.

**A Final Word: From Parasite to Sovereignty**

You have been living your entire life with one or more of these entities attached to your energy field, influencing your decisions, amplifying your shadows, and feeding on your suffering. But now you know. Now you can see them, now you can name them, and now you can remove them.

These seven entities maintain their power by remaining invisible, by convincing you that your destructive patterns are just your personality, "human nature," or psychological issues that require therapy but never actually resolve.

But they're not psychological. They're parasitical. And parasites can be removed once you recognize they're there.

Do the work. Perform the banishments. Reclaim your consciousness and finally experience what it's like to live as a sovereign being, free from parasitic influence.
