Everyone is born innocent. A newborn baby is sinless, as it has not done anything.

Before he was born, people turned away from the divine presence and their divine nature. They became sinful, missing the point that they have to be the embodiment of the divine.

A baby is born innocent, but he is born in sin. The society and environment in which they are born is sinful.&#x20;

There is lust, anger, immorality, greed, hypnotic trance, delusion and other evils in their family, neighbourhood and environment.  Sometimes dark entities enter them. In some cases, the evil is so much that witches put such things in them.

And that sin enters them, they absorb all these evils, and lose touch with their divine nature and contact with divinity.

Inside every person is a compass needle. It is never still. It moves, shifts, searches, and rarely settles. But wherever it stops, that is the realm your mind connects to.

When someone lets their needle point toward hell, their mind becomes like the mind of the devil. Their heart knots itself to darkness, and before they even realise it, their life fills with struggle, confusion, and destruction. They walk straight into it because the needle led them there.

When the needle stops in the direction of lust, the mind plugs directly into the rot of lust. Through that opening, the filth behind lust, its ghosts, its parasites, its predators, snakes, forces its way in. They take over the mind. And people under that influence become attached to the opposite sex in a way that isn’t even human anymore. They become nothing more than tools to satisfy the hunger of those ghosts.

But those who hold pure thoughts, whose needle points toward the good, toward the light of heaven, they are different. Their minds connect upward. The ones in the higher realms watch them with joy, with recognition. Their hearts feel peace while still alive, because their needle is aligned with the realm of peace.

There are also those who think only of helping others, without pride or show, who want nothing but to walk the righteous path. Their minds stay in tune with the heavenly realm. Peace becomes natural to them.

The needle of the mind moves in ways we cannot see. But wherever it rests, it will lead a person straight to heaven or straight to hell. One thought can open three thousand worlds. Heaven and hell begin inside the mind.

True enlightenment is found only in quiet, in harmony, in a mind that has stopped scattering itself. You must steady the needle inside you. Direct it toward the divine. Keep it pointing to the One who is above all.

Point the needle toward the divine presence so that we consciously absorb the light as we unconsciously absorbed the darkness growing up.
