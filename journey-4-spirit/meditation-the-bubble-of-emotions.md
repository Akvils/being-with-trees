#### Part 1: Foundation and Awakening the Body

Sit in a comfortable position.

Gently close your eyes.

Bring your awareness inward and upward to a point in the middle of your forehead, about an inch above the bridge of your nose. Do not look up with your physical eyes or strain in any way. Simply be conscious of this point with your mind's eye, as if you were standing back inside yourself, observing. Let your awareness rest here.

Now, from this observation point, let your awareness travel down into your body.

First, notice your hands. Feel the blood flowing into them. Feel for a warmth, a tingling. Shift your attention from one finger to the other until you can feel the presence of your hands without even having to think of them.

Now, expand this feeling of aliveness. Let it travel up from your hands into your arms. Feel your forearms, your elbows, and your upper arms, all humming with this same warm, tingling energy.

Bring this awareness up to your shoulders, and then let it spread across your entire upper torso. Feel your chest and your upper back becoming alive with sensation.

Let the awareness travel down your spine and fill your entire abdomen and lower back. Feel this core part of you become warm and present.

Now, bring your attention down to your legs. Feel your thighs, your knees, your calves, and your shins. Feel the tingling come. Make them feel alive with your attention.

Finally, bring your full awareness to your feet. Feel the soles of your feet, your heels, your toes. Feel them alive with life.

Now, feel your entire body at once, from the top of your head to the tips of your toes, as one complete field of warm, tingling aliveness.

Hold this feeling of total body awareness. Keep doing this as we proceed.

(Long Pause)

**The Core Practice of Observation**

You are aware of your entire body, a field of aliveness. You are aware of the point in your forehead, from which you observe.

Now, notice every thought that tries to steal your attention away. Do not follow your thoughts into the stream of dream-stuff. Do not allow imagination to draw your attention. Do not struggle. Do not strain. Realise no effort is required. Observe gently.

The moment you become conscious that your awareness has been captured by a thought, a memory, a daydream, or mental chatter, the practice begins.

As if you were looking right through the middle of your forehead, extend your awareness of that distracting thought down into your entire body until it tingles and glows warm, as though it were becoming flushed with blood.

The cycle is this: Watch the thought. Feel the body.

Repeat this again and again. As if looking through your forehead, quietly watch that thought pulling your attention, and then include the awareness of your whole body until it tingles and feels full of life. Feel your awareness extend and flow right down into your arms and legs.

Practice this until you find yourself being less involved and fascinated by your thoughts. By merely observing layers of distracting thought in this way, they will gradually dissolve and lose their power to hold your attention.

This is the practice. Be aware of thoughts as though you are looking through the middle of your forehead, and at the same time, become aware of your body until it tingles and feels full of life.

(Long, Deep Silence for Practice)

#### Part 2: The New Understanding

Now, we go deeper. We will learn to watch emotions and release them.

Emotions are the energy that creates thousands of thoughts. When the energy of an emotion is released, the thousands of thoughts it was creating simply disappear. When that happens, you feel lighter and more peaceful.

In this practice, we will learn how to release these basic emotions. This is a drill, a training, so that when these feelings arise in your daily life, you will know how to let them go.

#### Part 3: The Map - The Bubble of Suffering

Begin by seeing a vast, open space between your eyebrows. This is your true nature, boundless and aware.

Within this space, notice a single, tiny dot. This dot is your suffering.

Now, zoom in on that dot. Watch as it expands, filling your entire perception. See how it makes you forget the vast, open space that holds it.

This dot is a bubble. All your suffering has as much substance as this soap bubble. What happens when a bubble is poked? It pops. This meditation is the tool you will use to pop it.

The layers of this bubble are the emotions you will now travel through.

The surface layer is Apathy. Here, you feel "I can't." You feel like a victim. You have given up.

Just beneath it, with a little more energy, is Grief. Here, the feeling is, "I can't, but maybe someone else can help me."

Deeper still is Fear. You want to act, but you are afraid of what will happen. You feel a sense of impending doom.

Closer to the core is Lust. Here, you feel, "I want it, but I can't have it." There is strong desire, but also a strong holdback.

Even closer is Anger. The feeling is, "It's their fault, and they will pay." It is a destructive energy pushing out at the world.

Next is Pride. You feel you are above everyone else, but underneath is the secret fear: "I did it once, but can I do it again?"

Now, we come to the center of the bubble, to the states of release.

First is Courage. Here, you feel, "I can do it." Half your energy is now open and available.

Next is Acceptance. Here, everything is beautiful as it is. There is a feeling of love and care. There is no need to change anything.

And at the very core, blending into the space around it, is Peace. This is the feeling of just being. It is what is left when the bubble bursts.

This is the energy scale. In apathy, you have no energy. In peace, all energy is available to you.

As you release these layers, you will naturally move up this scale. It is not a straight line. You will go up and down. But the direction will be toward the core, toward peace, until you discover that peace is what you have always been.

Be open to this possibility: no matter how long you have suffered, you can drop any feeling in this very moment.

#### Part 4: The Method of Release

Now, we will begin the process of releasing through these emotions, from the outer layers to the inner core.

You do not have to do anything special. Simply allow yourself to focus inside.

As each emotion is named, welcome whatever arises in your experience. Welcome any sensations you feel in your body, any thoughts that appear, any sounds or pictures that occur in your mind.

There is no need to do anything with them yet. Accept them. Just let them be there.

We will use two simple techniques.

For the first six emotions, the denser energies from Apathy to Pride, we will focus on letting go. You will be guided to breathe into the feeling and then release it. You will also be asked three simple questions to help set it free.

It is helpful to understand the purpose of these questions.

The first question, "Could you let it go?", is about Possibility. It gently asks if release is possible, opening a door in your mind.

The second question, "Would you?", is about Willingness. This is your personal choice to step through that door toward freedom.

The third question, "When?", is about Action. It brings the release into this very moment. The only answer is "Now."

For the last three emotions, the higher energies of Courage, Acceptance, and Peace, we will focus on welcoming. Since these are your natural state, you cannot "let them go." Instead, you will be guided to open to them, embrace them, and allow them to flow.

Remember, as you practice this, it is safe to feel these emotions, because you are also learning that you can easily let them go.

#### Part 5: The Journey Through the Bubble

#### Section A: Releasing Apathy

We begin on the surface of the bubble, with the feeling of Apathy.

In apathy, you feel as though desire is dead and it is no use. You feel you cannot do anything, and no one else can help. You feel dense, heavy, and see no way out. You withdraw and play weak so you will not get hurt. Your mind can get so noisy that you may go numb.

The mental pictures are limited and destructive, so that you see only failure. You see how you cannot do it, and how no one else can either. You have little or no energy to act because inwardly, you are being pulled in many conflicting directions.

Here are some of the words that describe apathy. As they are spoken, just notice what arises.

Bored... Can't win... Careless... Cold... Cut-off... Dead... Defeated... Depressed... Demoralized... Desolate... Despair... Discouraged... Disillusioned... Doomed... Drained... Failure... Forgetful... Futile... Giving up... Hardened... Hopeless... Humorless... I can't... I don't care... I don't count... Inattentive... Indecisive... Indifferent... Invisible... It's too late... Lazy... Let it wait... Listless... Loser... Lost... Negative... Numb... Overwhelmed... Powerless... Resigned... Shock... Spaced out... Stoned... Stuck... Too tired... Unfeeling... Unfocused... Useless... Vague... Wasted... What's the use?... Why try?... Worthless.

Now, in this moment, just welcome whatever you are experiencing. Any sounds, pictures, or sensations in your body related to this emotion.

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, pictures or sounds in your mind that you are experiencing... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever is arising in association with the feeling of apathy.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Now, simply welcome the feeling of apathy. Welcome whatever sounds, pictures, or sensations you are experiencing because of it.

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

And as best you can, could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, whatever pictures or sounds are in your mind... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Then, could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever arises in association with the feeling of apathy.

(Pause)

Then, as best as you can, could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section B: Releasing Grief

Now, let's move up to Grief.

In grief, you want someone else to help because you feel you cannot do anything on your own. You hope that maybe someone else can. You cry out in pain for someone to do it for you.

The body has a little more energy than in apathy, but it is so contracted that it is painful. The mind is a little less cluttered, but still very noisy and opaque. You picture your pain and loss, often getting lost in these images. Your thoughts revolve around ideas of how much you hurt, what you have lost, and whether or not you can get anyone else to help you.

While in apathy you numb yourself out, in grief there is more discomfort.

Here are some of the words that describe grief. Just notice what arises.

Abandoned... Abused... Accused... Anguished... Ashamed... Betrayed... Blue... Cheated... Despair... Disappointed... Distraught... Embarrassed... Forgotten... Guilty... Heartbroken... Heartache... Heartsick... Helpless... Hurt... If only... Ignored... Inadequate... Inconsolable... It's not fair... Left out... Longing... Loss... Melancholy... Misunderstood... Mourning... Neglected... Nobody cares... Nobody loves me... Nostalgia... Passed over... Pity... Poor me... Regret... Rejected... Remorse... Sadness... Sorrow... Tearful... Tormented... Torn... Tortured... Unhappy... Unloved... Unwanted... Vulnerable... Why me?... Wounded.

Now, welcome whatever feeling arises when you focus on this grief energy—sensations in your body, sounds, pictures, thoughts. You might also have a reactive emotion that is not grief itself. It does not matter.

Just let it be there as best as you can.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever you are experiencing at this moment. Just let it be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever you are feeling—any sensations, sounds, or pictures associated with it.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Now, just welcome the feeling of grief, in whatever form it is arising. Just let it be there as best as you can.

(Pause)

Then, as best you can, could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever sadness or grief you are experiencing right now. Just let it be here.

(Pause)

Could you let it go, as best as you can?\
Would you let it go?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever you are feeling at this moment—any sensations, sounds, or pictures associated with this feeling.

(Pause)

Could you let that go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section C: Releasing Fear

Now, let's move up to Fear.

In fear, you want to strike out, but you do not because you think the risk is too great. You believe "they" will probably hit you harder. You want to reach out, but you do not because you think you will get hurt.

The body has a little more energy than in grief, but it is still so contracted that it is mostly in pain. Feelings can rise and fall very rapidly, like water on a hot pan. The mind is a little less cluttered than in grief, but still very noisy and opaque.

Your thoughts are about doom and destruction. All you can think and see is how you will get hurt, what you may lose, and how you can protect yourself and those around you.

Here are some of the words that describe fear. As they are spoken, just notice what arises.

Anxious... Apprehensive... Cautious... Clammy... Cowardice... Defensive... Distrust... Doubt... Dread... Embarrassed... Evasive... Foreboding... Frantic... Hesitant... Horrified... Hysterical... Inhibited... Insecure... Irrational... Nausea... Nervous... Panic... Paralyzed... Paranoid... Scared... Secretive... Shaky... Shy... Skeptical... Stage fright... Superstitious... Suspicious... Tense... Terrified... Threatened... Timid... Trapped... Uncertain... Uneasy... Vulnerable... Want to escape... Wary... Worry.

Now, in this moment, just welcome whatever you are experiencing. Any sounds, pictures, or sensations in your body related to this emotion.

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, pictures or sounds in your mind that you are experiencing... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever is arising in association with the feeling of fear.

Would you?\
When?

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, whatever pictures or sounds are in your mind... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever arises in association with the feeling of fear.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section D: Releasing Lust

Let's move to Lust.

Lust is the first feeling that you might think is a good feeling. But there is still a holdback, a feeling that "I can't have it." There is a powerful wanting, but not an allowing yourself to have.

In lust, you desire possession. You are WANTING. You hunger for money, power, sex, people, places, and things, but with hesitation. You may or may not reach out. You have an underlying feeling that you cannot or should not have what you want.

The body has a little more energy than in fear. It is still quite contracted, but the sensations now are sometimes pleasurable, especially compared to the lower-energy emotions. Feelings can be very intense. The mind is a little less cluttered than in fear, but still noisy and obsessive. You may try to paint your pictures with positive fantasies, but underneath, your pictures are really about what you do not have. Your thoughts are about what you need to get and what you lack. No matter how much you do get, you never feel satisfied and rarely enjoy what you have.

If you are hesitant to let go of lust, simply ask yourself, "Would I rather want that? Or would I rather have it?"

Here are some of the words that describe lust. Just notice what arises.

Abandon... Anticipation... Callous... Can't wait... Compulsive... Craving... Demanding... Devious... Driven... Envy... Exploitive... Fixated... Frenzy... Frustrated... Gluttonous... Greedy... Hoarding... Hunger... I want... Impatient... Lascivious... Lecherous... Manipulative... Miserly... Must have it... Never enough... Never satisfied... Oblivious... Obsessed... Overindulgent... Possessive... Predatory... Pushy... Reckless... Ruthless... Scheming... Selfish... Voracious... Wanton... Wicked.

Now, in this moment, just welcome whatever you are experiencing. Any sounds, pictures, or sensations in your body related to this emotion.

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, pictures or sounds in your mind that you are experiencing... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, whatever pictures or sounds are in your mind... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever arises in association with the feeling of lust.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section E: Releasing Anger

Let's move up to Anger.

In anger, you desire to strike out, to hurt and stop others, but with hesitation. You may or may not strike out.

The body has a little more energy than in lust. It is less contracted, and the sensations can often be very intense and explosive. The mind is a little less cluttered than in lust, but still noisy, stubborn, and obsessive. Your thought-pictures are about what you are going to do to others, and of destruction. Your thoughts are about what you can do to get even and how you are going to make others pay. This energy can frighten you and cause you to move back down into lower-energy levels, or to hurt yourself. The actions you take are mostly destructive to those around you and to yourself.

Many of us keep ourselves below the energy of anger because we think we should not feel that way. But remember, it is just energy. It is not good, not bad, not right, not wrong.

Here are some of the words that describe anger. Just notice what arises.

Abrasive... Aggressive... Annoyed... Argumentative... Belligerent... Boiling... Brooding... Caustic... Defiant... Demanding... Destructive... Disgust... Explosive... Fierce... Frustrated... Fuming... Furious... Harsh... Hatred... Hostility... Impatience... Indignant... Irate... Jealous... Livid... Mad... Mean... Merciless... Murderous... Outraged... Petulant... Pushy... Rebellious... Resentment... Resistant... Revolted... Rude... Savage... Simmering... Sizzling... Smoldering... Spiteful... Steely... Stern... Stewing... Stubborn... Sullen... Vengeful... Vicious... Violent... Volcanic... Wicked... Willful.

Now, in this moment, just welcome whatever you are experiencing. Any sounds, pictures, or sensations in your body related to this emotion. If you feel any resistance to anger, welcome that resistance as well.

Just let it be here.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, pictures or sounds in your mind that you are experiencing... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever is arising in association with the feeling of anger.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever arises in association with the feeling of anger.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section F: Releasing Pride

Now, let's move up to Pride.

If it helps, you can even arch your head a little bit and give a little flick to get into the energy of pride.

In pride, you want to maintain the status quo. You are unwilling to change or move, and so you stop others from movement so they do not pass you by. The body has more energy than in anger, but it often becomes unavailable—muted and less visible. The mind is still noisy, but now it is rigid and self-involved. Your thoughts are about what you have done and what you know. If you are even aware of others, you hope they will notice how great you are to cover over your constant, hidden doubts.

Pride is a strange and sticky emotion. You can be proud of your apathy, proud of your grief, or proud of how angry you are. Of all the emotions, it has the least "feel" to it, which is why it is often the most stuck place we get into. Many of us also deny having any pride. But if you resonate with any of these words, you probably have it.

Here are some of the words that describe pride. Just notice what arises.

Above... Aloof... Arrogant... Bigoted... Boastful... Bored... Clever... Closed... Complacent... Conceited... Contemptuous... Cool... Critical... Disdain... Dogmatic... False dignity... False humility... False virtue... Gloating... Haughty... Holier than thou... Hypocritical... Icy... Isolated... Judgmental... Know-it-all... Narrow-minded... Never wrong... Opinionated... Overbearing... Patronizing... Pious... Prejudiced... Presumptuous... Reproach... Righteous... Rigid... Self-absorbed... Self-satisfied... Selfish... Smug... Snobbish... Special... Spoiled... Stoic... Stubborn... Stuck-up... Superior... Uncompromising... Unfeeling... Unforgiving... Unyielding... Vain.

Now, in this moment, just welcome whatever you are experiencing. Any sounds, pictures, or sensations in your body related to this emotion. If you have any resistance to pride, let that go as well.

Just let it be here.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, pictures or sounds in your mind that you are experiencing... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Again, welcome whatever is arising in association with the feeling of pride.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it go. Release it.

Now, simply welcome the feeling of pride. Welcome whatever sounds, pictures, or sensations you are experiencing because of it.

Just let them be here.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, whatever sensations are there in your body, whatever pictures or sounds are in your mind... just let them be here.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome whatever arises in association with the feeling of pride.

(Pause)

Could you let that feeling go?\
Would you?\
When?

#### Section G: Welcoming Courage

Now let's move to Courage.

In courage, you have the willingness to move without hesitation. You feel "I can do it." You can correct it. You can change whatever is needed. You have the willingness to let go and to move on.

The body has much more energy than in pride, and it is available for constructive action. Your energy is high, available, and clear. The mind is far less cluttered and much less noisy. It is flexible, resilient, and open. Your thoughts are about what you can do and learn, and how you can support others in doing the same. You are self-motivated and self-reliant, while still being willing for others to succeed. You can laugh out loud, even at your own mistakes. Life is fun.

Because we spend so much time in the lower emotions, we sometimes cling to these higher feelings with a sense of scarcity. This is why we will now switch from "letting go" to simply "welcoming." The more you let go of the lower energies, the more these higher states are naturally uncovered.

Here are some of the words that describe courage. Just notice what arises.

Adventurous... Alert... Alive... Assured... Aware... Centered... Certain... Cheerful... Clarity... Compassion... Competent... Confident... Creative... Daring... Decisive... Dynamic... Eager... Enthusiastic... Exhilaration... Explorative... Flexible... Focused... Giving... Happy... Honorable... Humor... I can... Independent... Initiative... Integrity... Invincible... Loving... Lucid... Motivated... Non-resistant... Open... Optimistic... Perspective... Positive... Purposeful... Receptive... Resilient... Resourceful... Responsive... Secure... Self-sufficient... Sharp... Spontaneous... Strong... Supportive... Tireless... Vigorous... Visionary... Willing... Zest.

Welcome this energy into your awareness. Just let it be here. Notice any sounds, sensations, or pictures that arise with it.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Again, welcome this courageous energy. Notice what sensations, pictures, or sounds arise with it.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Again, welcome the energy of courage. Really let it be here, along with any sensations, pictures, and sounds that arise with it.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Now, welcome this energy into your awareness.\
As best as you can, could you be open to it? Could you allow it and welcome it fully?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, welcome this courageous energy. Notice what sensations, pictures, or sounds arise with it.\
Could you fully embrace this energy, right here and now?\
Would you?\
When?

Welcome the energy of courage into your awareness. As best as you can, be open to it. Allow it. Welcome it fully.\
Would you?\
When?

Remember, you tap into the energy of courage every time you say "yes" to the releasing questions. Even when you are feeling sad, anxious, or lonely, there is a courageous energy deep within you that you access the moment you choose to let go.

#### Section H: Welcoming Acceptance

Now, let's look at Acceptance.

In acceptance, you have and enjoy everything as it is. There is no need to change anything. It just is, and it is okay. It is beautiful just as it is.

The body has even more energy than in courageousness, yet it is mostly at rest, available if you need it. Your energy is light, warm, and open. The mind is much less cluttered and is mostly quiet and content. Your thoughts are in love with the beauty of what is. Life is joyful.

Here are some of the words that describe acceptance. Just notice what arises.

Abundance... Appreciative... Balance... Beautiful... Belonging... Childlike... Compassion... Considerate... Delight... Elated... Embracing... Empathy... Enriched... Everything's okay... Friendly... Fullness... Gentle... Glowing... Gracious... Harmonious... Harmony... Intuitive... I have... In tune... Joyful... Loving... Magnanimous... Mellow... Naturalness... Nothing to change... Open... Playful... Radiant... Receptive... Secure... Soft... Tender... Understanding... Warm... Well-being... Wonder.

Welcome this energy. Notice whatever sensations, pictures, or sounds arise with it.

(Pause)

Now, breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold it. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Again, welcome the energy of acceptance. Notice what arises.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Again, welcome the feeling of acceptance and all that comes with it.

(Pause)

Breathe into this feeling. Breathe fully, deep into your belly.\
Hold. Feel that feeling there. One... two... three... four...\
And with an out-breath, making a 'shhh' sound, let it flow from you.

Now, could you just welcome the energy of acceptance? Just let it be here. As best as you can, could you be open to it? Could you really allow it?\
Would you?\
When?

Again, focus on the energy of acceptance. Could you allow it to be here fully?\
Would you?\
When?

Welcome the energy of acceptance into your awareness. Could you just really let it be here? Could you embrace it, allow it, welcome it as best as you can?\
Would you?\
When?

This is where the feeling of having comes from. Notice the first word for acceptance was abundance. It comes from accepting what is, not from wanting.

#### Section I: Resting in Peace

We have just one more feeling to experience in this imaginary bubble, and that is Peace.

There are not a lot of words to describe peace, mostly because we so often ignore the peace that is already here.

In peace, the feeling is simply "I am." I am whole, complete, and total unto myself. Everyone and everything is part of myself. It is all perfect.

The body has more energy than in any other state, yet it is totally at rest, completely still. The energy is quiet and calm. The mind is clear and empty, yet totally aware. There is no need for pictures or thoughts. Life is as it is, and all is well.

Here are some words that describe peace.

Ageless... Awareness... Being... Bliss... Boundless... Calm... Centered... Complete... Eternal... Free... Fulfilled... Glowing... I am... Imperturbable... Knowingness... Light... Oneness... Perfection... Presence... Pure... Quiet... Serenity... Space... Still... Timeless... Tranquility... Unlimited... Whole.

Now, as best as you can, just sink into that feeling.

You may want to rest yourself in it for a moment. This is what is always here, always now. We are just usually looking away from it.

As best as you can, could you welcome the sensations, sounds, and pictures that arise in peace? Could you welcome them fully?\
Would you?\
When?

Focus on that again. Welcome the energy of peace and presence that is always there at your core. Also welcome the sensations, sounds, and pictures that arise in that energy. As best as you can, could you just be open to that energy? Could you welcome it?\
Would you?\
When?

Could you just simply welcome the energy that is peace, your natural state? Could you open to it, and to the sensations, pictures, and sounds? Could you welcome it and allow it?\
Would you?\
When?

Just rest as the awareness, as the peace that you are.

#### Part 6: Integration - The Truth About Feelings

Remain resting in this state of peace for a moment longer as you absorb this final understanding.

Feelings lie.

They tell you that by letting them go, you will lose something important. The truth is, you only lose what you already have by holding on to them.

A feeling might tell you that you will be weak if you do not hold on to it. The exact opposite is true. Every one of those lower emotions, apathy, grief, fear, lust, anger, pride, is sucking energy from your aliveness. When you are lost in an emotion, you do not see as well, you do not hear as well, you do not feel as well. None of that helps you. It does the exact opposite.

Your true source of strength is that which you already are, the peace, the presence you are resting in now. The emotions are simply coverings over that.

Remember the soap bubble. That is how much substance all your feelings have. Yet, whenever the bubble starts to deflate, we tend to blow air back into it. We think it is important, special, and significant. We think our strength comes from there.

It does not. That is the lie.

#### Part 7: The Return - Walking in Release

Continue to rest as the awareness, the peace that you are.

From this place of stillness, begin to bring your awareness back to your physical body, sitting here against the solid trunk of the tree.

Feel the texture of the bark against your back. Feel the firm earth beneath you.

Listen to the sounds of this place... the rustle of leaves, the gentle stirrings of the world around you. Feel the air on your skin.

When you are ready, and only when you are ready, allow your eyelids to slowly and gently open. Take in the light and the colors around you, seeing them from this place of inner quiet.

Now, with a feeling of deep peace and emptiness, arise.

Stand up.

This part of the journey is now complete. Carry this feeling with you.

Walk forward now, in this state of release.
