> "I know you’re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you’re afraid. You’re afraid of us. You’re afraid of change. I don’t know the future. I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin. I’m going to hang up this phone and then I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see. I’m going to show them a world without you, a world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you." - Neo

So now you know what you didn't know that you didn't know. You know how to journey. Now you can quit being a tourist and start travelling. You can go back now and see if the walk of shame is the same. I hope you make the shift and enter the divine order. Good luck, my friend! \

If I see you, I will recognise you. Let's meet in the Garden of Eden :deciduous\_tree:
