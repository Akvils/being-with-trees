# 🌄 Origin Story

### Part I: The Departure and the First Encounter

My time in Estonia was coming to an end. I had built a life there, love, friends, a community. Everything I needed was rooted in that place. But suddenly, it all began to dissolve, and I found myself asking the spirit of the Baltic Sea: “Why are you sending me away? I thought I had to work with you. Why am I leaving, when I have everything here?”

The sea spirit answered: “You have to go there. Do not worry. My daughters will take care of you.” He even named them, but I did not understand. I was too unsettled to make sense of this, but when he spoke of his first daughter, I had a vision: I was playing my shamanic drum before her, as if invoking or honouring her.

In February 2023, I moved to Vilnius. It was the heart of winter. Cold, dark, wet, empty, and depressing. The streets were deserted; the silence heavy. I thought I had made the biggest mistake of my life. Yet signs kept pointing me forward, in their quiet, invisible ways.

I told my friend Indrek that I felt sick from the energy of this place, that I didn’t know anyone. He replied with words that would stay with me: “If you don’t make friends in the human world, you will make many friends in the spirit world.” Later, he admitted this message had been channelled.

The sickness grew worse. My body grew heavy, filled with anger and fatigue.&#x20;

One day, returning from the gym, I felt anger and heaviness swelling inside me. Then I heard a whisper, “Come here.” I paused and asked, “Who is it?” Three birch trees stood before me.

They called me closer and said, “We will take it away from you.” I placed my hand on one of them, and immediately I felt the dark weight being drawn out of me. Within minutes, I felt light again, as if the sickness had lifted.

I thanked them and introduced myself: “I am Akvil, I’m new here.”

They replied: “We know.”

Surprised, I asked: “How do you know me?”

And they answered: “You are the one who does puja every morning. That is how we know you.”

It was my first true conversation with the trees of this land, and it marked the beginning of a different kind of friendship.

But still, the sickness continued for months, deeper and deeper, beyond what any doctor could heal. By the end of May, my health was failing, and my manager even suggested seeing a doctor. I knew, though, this was not an illness of the body but of the spirit.

One Wednesday, I felt an urge to reach out to my friend Indrek. It took me a couple of days to finally send him a message: “I feel like I should talk to you.” He replied that he had been feeling the same, so we arranged a call.

On the call, I shared how difficult life had been in Vilnius: I didn’t know anyone, I didn’t speak the language, I didn’t recognise the landscape, and I couldn’t eat most of the food here. Everything felt unfamiliar, and it was challenging to the core.

So I asked him: “Did you see the spirit of the Baltic Sea recently?”

He said yes, that a few days earlier, while out for a run, the spirit had appeared and greeted him. He felt special about it.

I paused, then asked: “So what did he say? If he came to you, and since then we’ve both been feeling this pull to talk, he must have a message.”

Indrek said: “Oh, that makes sense… I don’t know. Ask him.”

So I did. I went on a shamanic journey, calling upon the spirit of the Baltic Sea. He appeared, but instead of comfort, he simply said: “Akvil, you are wasting your time.” Then he turned his back and walked away.

I was left confused. What was I doing wrong?

A few days later, I felt another pull, this time calling toward the Upper World. I followed it. In that journey, I found myself before a powerful figure, Indra, Zeus, or as the Lithuanians call him, Perkūnas.

I asked him, “Did you call me?”

He said yes.

“Why?” I asked.

“Because I wanted to see who you were,” he replied.

“This is me,” I said. “Why did you want to see me?”

And he answered, “Because you work with my brother.”

Only later did I realise what this meant, that this land belonged to him, and I had entered into his domain.

On May 31st was the full moon of Buddha Purnima, the day of the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment, and passing. I felt like I should to a forest, to meditate or perform a ritual. But my manager refused my request for leave, saying coldly, “This is no time for festivities.” His words carried the weight of the toxic human world.

### May 31st: Buddha Purnima

On the morning of the full moon of Buddha Purnima, I woke to a message, “Shave your head.” I did, without question. Another message followed, “keep the hair”. I gathered the cut strands and kept them safe in my drum bag.

The day unfolded like any other. I worked, feeling steady, until six in the evening, when I finished my tasks and prepared to go to the forest. I chose Vingis Park, as that’s the only place I knew with a wide expanse of trees on the edge of Vilnius, and decided to bring my drum to meditate there.

Following Google Maps, I went to the bus stop and boarded the listed route. But it was the wrong bus. I got off after a few stops, checked the maps again, and tried once more, the correct bus number, the correct stop, the correct time. Still wrong. This second bus carried me in the opposite direction.

A woman seated nearby confirmed it: “You’re going the wrong way. Get down at the next stop, cross the street, and take the bus from there.”

I did as she advised. When I crossed the street, I found myself before a river. I asked a man beside me its name. “Neris,” he said.

The name struck me. Neris was one of the daughters of the Baltic Sea, a name that had come to me with a vision. I remembered that vision, I was to play my drum for her. And now, with the drum in my hands, the moment had arrived.

I descended the steps to the riverbank, sat before her waters, and began to drum. A rhythm unfamiliar to me rose on its own. The drum altered my state of consciousness. The spirit of Neris rose, and I too left my body, riding upon my power animal.

An exchange unfolded, visions, energy, currents of force, I cannot fully recall. It lasted perhaps fifteen minutes. Later, I understood this as an initiation, a recognition from the spirits of this land that I could work with them.

When it was done, Neris receded, and I returned to my body. She asked, “Do you have your hair?” I placed the strands I had saved inside my drum and offered them, along with a small sweet, as gifts.

Still in trance, I walked along the riverbanks, drumming softly, light rhythms flowing like the current. For half an hour, I moved beside Neris in this altered state, until at last I returned to the city.

### The Hill of Three Crosses

When I climbed up from the river I found myself in the city, I opened my eyes fully for the first time. I realised, “I am in no state to be among people. I must go to the forest.”

A cyclist passed, and I stopped him. “Is there a forest nearby? I want to be in nature.” He replied, “Yes, just across the street is the Hill of Three Crosses. You can go there. It’s like a forest there.”

The name struck me. When I had once been held by the birches, I had seen the Hill of Three Crosses from their hill, and I had felt a calling from it, a subtle energy. Now it was clear. I crossed the street and began to climb.

Wooden stairs rose into the hillside. As soon as I placed my right foot upon the first step, I felt it, an energetic barrier. This was a sacred place. Slowly, calmly, meditatively, I ascended, sensing the presence of the trees, attuning to the energy of the land.

At the top, I found a fire altar, a circle of stones. In its centre was a place for offerings, one side for water, one for gifts, and in the middle, a living, eternal flame. I sat upon one of the stones and began to drum.

The wind rose at once, rushing through the trees, circling me. The spirits had gathered. I entered meditation and turned inward to cleanse my energy body. From the base of my spine upward, chakra by chakra, I examined and purified red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. At the third eye, indigo, I found a block. I tried to clear it, but it returned. Above it, violet. I worked as best I could, cleansing what I could reach.

For half an hour, I remained at the altar, purifying. Then I was instructed to move upward.

I climbed to the Hill of Three Crosses itself. There, after the drama of the day, so many events already behind me, I made an offering at the flame. I intended only to sit for a few minutes. But then came the instruction, “Meditate here.”

I resisted. Enough has happened. I can ignore this one. I stood to leave.

A force pushed me back. Never before had the spirits acted with such firmness. The message was clear, “Meditate here.”

I obeyed.

I sat down and entered meditation. At once, I was drawn into Samadhi, timeless, spaceless, an eternal void. For an hour and a half, I remained there. Something was being done to my body, yet I could not move, could not speak.

At one point, a thought broke through, “Who are you? What are you doing to me?” A voice answered gently: “Relax. We are healing you. Come back later, and we will answer your questions. For now, only relax.”

So I surrendered.

When at last I opened my eyes, I was renewed. A psychic surgery had been performed in that hour and a half; the dense sickness and heavy energies of two and a half months had been stripped away.

I was astonished. “What is this place?”

And the answer came, “We are from here. Come back next week, and we will tell you.”

### The Return and the Story of the City

That night, I went home. It was late, and I slept deeply, peacefully.

The next day, at the office, my manager, who knew I had been unwell and had wanted to see a doctor, saw me. He looked at me with surprise. I was healthy, normal, smiling.

“Did you see a doctor?” he asked.

“No,” I replied. “I went to the Hill of Three Crosses and meditated.”

I wanted to share what had truly happened, the magnitude of it, but I could not. Still, he nodded and said, “That place is very special.”

Then he told me a story: Grand Duke Gediminas, drunk, had once passed out and dreamt of an Iron Wolf. When he awoke, he went to a man named Lizdeika, who interpreted the dream. Lizdeika told him that he should build his castle on that site.

I listened, astonished. So this place is not ordinary. Is this what the spirit meant when he said I was wasting my time?

From then on, I began returning to the hill regularly. That whole summer, week by week, I went there, meditating, speaking with the deity who resided there.

One day, I asked directly: Who are you?

The answer came: I am Vilnelė.

Surprised, I asked again, That’s the name of the river?

I am Vilnelė, she replied.

I asked her to reveal herself. It took time, but at last I saw: a being of white light, long-haired, radiant and beautiful beyond words.

Slowly, she showed me more. She revealed that the place itself was an energetic site, a shamanic ground built and tended long ago by a deeply spiritual people who, over the centuries, had lost touch with their roots. Once, during my visits, the spirits said to me: Akvil come more often. Nobody speaks to us anymore.

<mark style="color:$warning;">I did not always return as often as they asked, and I felt guilty for it. But the bond had been made.</mark>

They began to send me to other places, once to the museum, to see the old maps, and once to different places across the city. I was being shown the layers of Vilnius, its hidden lines of energy, its forgotten history.

One evening, on my way back, I met a girl named Akvilė. She told me the full and proper story of Vilnius’ founding: Gediminas, Lizdeika, the vision of the Iron Wolf, and the building of the city. Listening to her, I understood more deeply what had been revealed.

The Hill of Three Crosses was not just a monument. It was a magical place, a living centre of energy. Spending time there, learning its beauty and mystery, I felt a shift within me: This is my city.
