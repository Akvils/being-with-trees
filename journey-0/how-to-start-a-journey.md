# 🌅 How to Start a Journey?

These are a series of journeys, each one taking you deeper. We begin with what surrounds us: the land, the trees, the rivers, the air we breathe. Slowly, as you grow more familiar with the outer world, we turn inward, exploring the landscapes of the body, mind, and spirit.

At first, the practices may feel simple, even physical: walking, noticing, breathing, touching the bark of trees, feeling the ground beneath your feet. Over time, they will become subtler, entering states of silence, communion, and vision.

Think of this as learning a new language, the language of nature. At the start, you follow a structure, just as one learns letters and words. Later, as you grow fluent, you can speak freely, improvise, and weave your own conversations with the living world.

These journeys are not meant as rigid steps but as openings. Each one plants a seed. Some seeds sprout quickly; others take time. Allow yourself patience, and trust that the forest, the rivers, the stones, and the winds will reveal themselves to you in their own rhythm.

The structure of the journeys is intentional. At first, it is best to follow the steps as designed. They create distinctions, foundations of understanding and practice. Later, once these distinctions are clear, the path becomes your own. You will be free to weave your own rhythm, your own encounters, your own meditations.

Think of these journeys as a spiral: we begin on the surface, circling outward, and with each turn we move closer to the centre, the stillness within.

The first journey begins with the landscape. It is an introduction to the environment, and to the practice of moving through them with awareness.

#### Entering the Forest Journey

To begin the journey, choose two trees of the same kind, for example, two birch trees, two oak trees, or two pine trees, standing with a natural space between them.\
The space between these two trees is a portal, a gateway into the energetic forest.

Stand before this portal and set your intention for the journey. Keep the intention simple and sincere. The intention could be for healing, for clarity, for strength, for grounding, for gaining power or anything you wish to work with. The journey serves the intention, and nature responds by delivering what is needed.

When you are ready, step forward with your right foot, placing it between the two trees, as if entering the portal. This physical movement marks the beginning of the journey.

From this moment on, move with awareness, openness, and presence. Allow the forest to respond. Remain receptive, without forcing or controlling the experience. Nature serves the intention through the journey itself.

The journey unfolds through what you notice, what you feel, and how you are guided moment by moment.
