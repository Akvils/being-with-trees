# 🌅 How to Start a Journey?

These are a series of journeys, each one taking you deeper. We begin with what surrounds us: the land, the trees, the rivers, the air we breathe. Slowly, as you grow more familiar with the outer world, we turn inward, exploring the landscapes of the body, mind, and spirit.

At first, the practices may feel simple, even physical: walking, noticing, breathing, touching the bark of trees, feeling the ground beneath your feet. Over time, they will become subtler, entering states of silence, communion, and vision.

Think of this as learning a new language, the language of nature. At the start, you follow a structure, just as one learns letters and words. Later, as you grow fluent, you can speak freely, improvise, and weave your own conversations with the living world.

These journeys are not meant as rigid steps but as openings. Each one plants a seed. Some seeds sprout quickly; others take time. Allow yourself patience, and trust that the forest, the rivers, the stones, and the winds will reveal themselves to you in their own rhythm.

The structure of the journeys is intentional. At first, it is best to follow the steps as designed. They create distinctions, foundations of understanding and practice. Later, once these distinctions are clear, the path becomes your own. You will be free to weave your own rhythm, your own encounters, your own meditations.

Think of these journeys as a spiral: we begin on the surface, circling outward, and with each turn we move closer to the centre, the stillness within.

The first journey begins with the landscape. It is an introduction to the environment, and to the practice of moving through them with awareness.
