### Surrender

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/breathtaking_alla_prima_oil_pa copy 3.jpeg" alt="" width="384"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Close your eyes for the first process.\
Let the body relax.\
Keep it loose and at ease, soft, open, unguarded.

This first process is about flowing and drifting, the experience of being carried away.

Eyes closed. Body loose.\
Now begin to imagine a picture within.

Two mountains shimmer under the warmth of the sun.\
Between them, a river rushes, deep blue, flowing fast, alive with motion.

The river runs tirelessly in search of the sea, far away, somewhere in the unknown. She flows toward it with longing.

Look carefully at the river. Watch her movement. Feel her flow, because soon, we will enter her current and drift away.

See the mountains shining on both sides. The blue water running swiftly between them. A long journey unfolding.

Now, we are going to enter this river, not to swim, but to drift.\
We enter as if we have no hands, no legs, so the river may take us wherever she wishes.\
We do nothing. We simply float, learning the art of letting go.

This is not swimming; it is surrendering.\
Swimming requires effort, and effort is resistance.\
Drifting is trust. Drifting is surrender.

In meditation, we do not “do.” We allow.\
We let ourselves be carried by the river of the divine, wherever she flows, however she moves.

Now see: the river is running swiftly.\
Step in, fall into her current like a dry leaf dropped into a stream.\
Float. Do not swim. The river is already running; let her take you.

I will be silent for five minutes while you experience the drifting.\
You are inside the river, being carried effortlessly.

You are not swimming. You are not moving your hands or feet.\
No work. No effort.\
The river flows, and you are taken along, weightless, unburdened.\
You are not heavy for the river. She carries you with ease and joy.

Silence, the sounds of water, birds, and wind… merging into stillness.

Flowing away… drifting…\
The river runs, and you drift with her.\
You are doing nothing. The river is doing everything.

Let yourself go completely.\
You may begin to feel very light, very fresh.\
The mind grows quiet. The heart becomes calm.\
Flow.

Pause.

All burdens fall away.\
All stress dissolves.\
Flow.

Pause for two minutes.

Let go completely.\
Drop everything.\
Be like a child held in its mother’s arms, safe, surrendered, trusting.\
The river will take you.\
Flow fully.\
As you do, the mind becomes silent, weightless, fresh, and alive.

Flow with the river.

Pause.

Flowing… drifting…\
Do not swim. Do not try.\
Do not move your hands.\
The river carries you, you only flow.

Pause.

The mountains shine in the sunlight.\
The deep blue river runs, and you are moving with her.\
Everything is light, relaxed, calm.\
All tension has fallen away.\
Recognize this experience of flowing; this is the first step of meditation.

Pause.

Now slowly come out of the river.\
Stand again at her bank.\
Look at her flowing.

Can you notice the difference, before and after the flow?\
Observe your state.\
Is the mind lighter, calmer, fresher, new?

Stand here at the bank and feel it.\
Everything is fresh and still.\
The mind has become completely light.

### Experience Death

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/breathtaking_alla_prima_oil_pa copy 4.jpeg" alt="" width="384"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Understand the second process before you begin.\
Now comes the second experience, the experience of death. The experience of dying.

Loosen your body completely and enter the experience of dying for the next five minutes.\
Let go of all stiffness. Allow the body to become soft and weightless.

Imagine this second picture.

You are standing in a crematory. A body is burning on the funeral pyre.\
The flames rise toward the sky.\
Perhaps you have been to such a place before, to say goodbye to someone else.\
Perhaps you have not seen such a place; in that case, just see the picture and visualise.\
Because today, you have come to burn yourself.

Friends and family are gathered around.\
You see their faces flickering in the light of the flames.\
Look carefully. Those who once surrounded you in life are standing around the pyre.\
The fire burns brightly, and it is not someone else, but you who are burning.

See it clearly. You are the one lying on the pyre.\
Not someone else.\
Others have been burned many times before, and one day, others will place your body on the fire too.\
But in meditation, we burn ourselves and witness what happens.

See yourself in the pyre.\
Put yourself on fire.\
It is your face that burns, your hands, your body.

The pyre burns, and you are burning with it.\
The flames leap upward toward the sky.\
In a little while, everything will turn to ash.

Watch yourself burning on the pyre for five minutes.\
See the flames rise. Feel the fire consuming everything.

A strong wind blows, feeding the flames, making them fierce.\
You are burning. Your hands and legs are burning.\
Your face is burning. Your body is burning.\
Everything is burning.\
Watch it carefully. Everything is burning.

So that all that can burn is burned away, and that which cannot be burned remains.

PAUSE street noises

Everything is burning. You are burning.\
The flames grow larger as everything is consumed.\
Soon, only ash will remain.

The flames grow higher, the ash gathers below.\
Everything is coming to an end.

Watch as the faces that were once around you turn away.\
You see their backs as they walk into the distance.\
You hear the sound of their footsteps fading away.

They are gone. Everyone is gone.\
You are alone.

The body continues to burn. A heap of ash is forming.\
Burn. Be destroyed. Be finished.\
So that only that remains which cannot burn, cannot be destroyed, cannot end.

The flames begin to fade.\
The fire grows smaller.\
Soon, there is only darkness and a heap of ash lying in silence.

Look at this carefully.\
Experience what it means to be destroyed.\
This is the second step of meditation, the destruction of the self.

PAUSE crows

Everything is burning, dissolving, coming to an end.\
The flames vanish.\
Only a heap of ash remains.

That is you.\
This heap of ash on the ground is you.\
The soil has returned to the soil.\
Look at it closely. Recognise it.

Alone, surrounded by darkness, all flames gone.\
The fire has died out. The ash lies quietly on the ground.

Everything is gone, erased.\
And in this recognition, that everything has been destroyed, a deep silence and peace begins to enter.\
A solemn stillness fills the depths of your being.

With the feeling that “I have disappeared,”\
all stress dissolves, all disturbances vanish, all worries fade away.

All tension and sorrow were bound to me, and now, they too have burned with the body.\
Only silence remains.\
A vast, empty stillness inside.

PAUSE silence

Everything is gone. The heap of ash lies still.\
When we are no more, what pain remains? What restlessness, what sorrow?\
All of it is gone. Ended.

Understand this state of being destroyed and disappeared.\
This is the second step of meditation.

### Tathata: Suchness

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/the_person_radiates_love_every copy.jpeg" alt="" width="384"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Understand the third step of meditation before you begin.\
The first step was flowing.\
The second was destruction.\
And the third is tathata, suchness.

Suchness is the very centre of meditation.\
Suchness means to accept things as they are.\
There is no opposition, no resistance.\
It is the state of non-resistance.

We completely accept things as they are.\
We do not wish for them to be different.\
We do not desire them to change.

Birds are chirping, and we accept their cries.\
They are birds; they will make sound.

The wind blows, the leaves move and create noise, and we accept that too.\
They are leaves; they will move and make sound.

Someone passes by on the street.\
A vehicle comes and makes noise.\
We accept that as well.

We accept life in its totality.\
Suchness means accepting everything without opposing anything.

When there is no opposition, where can restlessness exist?\
Then, where is the obstacle or problem?

When there is no resistance, consciousness dissolves inward, becoming empty, vast, and still.

The ego is created in opposition.\
The more we resist, the stronger the “I” becomes.\
The more we say, not like this, not this, not that, the stronger the ego grows.

But when we say, things are as they are, let them be as they are,\
then there is no ground for the ego to stand upon.

Experience suchness for five minutes.\
Understand it deeply.\
Then we will bring together all three steps.

Close your eyes and relax the body.\
Let the body be soft and loose.\
Eyes closed, the body relaxed.

We do not oppose anything.\
We accept the world as it is.

The streets are noisy; we accept that.\
There is no resistance in the mind.

Look within carefully.\
Do you resist anything?

Birds are making sounds, we accept it.\
There is no resistance to that sound.

The sun is shining; we accept it.\
There is no resistance to the harsh sunlight.

Whatever is, we accept it.\
No resistance, not outside, not inside.

Pain arises in the leg, or the leg becomes numb, we accept it.\
There is no resistance.

Thoughts arise in the mind; we accept them too.\
There is no resistance.

Dive deep into this feeling of non-resistance.\
Things are the way they are.\
We accept them.\
We do not wish them to be different.

We are in total acceptance of all that is.

And as we accept, one thing at a time,\
everything begins to dissolve.\
Deep peace, silence, and emptiness emerge.

Now, dive deeply into this feeling of suchness for the next five minutes.

PAUSE

Leave yourself completely.\
Things are the way they are, and we accept everything.

When everything is accepted, love begins to flow in all directions.\
You hear the birds differently now.\
You perceive the sounds of the street differently.\
Love begins to flow toward everything.

And the mind becomes peaceful.\
Everything is accepted, whatever it is, however it is.

Pause

This is accepted. That is accepted.\
Whatever it is, it is accepted.

Immerse yourself in the feeling of complete acceptance.\
The sun is hot, it is accepted.\
The shadow is cool, that is accepted.

Let go. Leave everything.\
Everything is accepted.

We become one with everything as soon as we accept.\
Then the wind is not separate,\
the sunlight is not separate,\
the sound of birds is not separate,\
the movement of trees is not separate.

We are one with all of these.

Let go completely and accept.\
Sink into acceptance.\
Everything is accepted.

Let go of everything and accept things as they are.\
Accept everything for the next five minutes.

Pause

Let go. Drop it all.\
Accept everything.\
Immerse yourself fully.

Submerge into this vast ocean of existence.\
Everything is accepted.\
Acceptance fills the mind with peace and bliss.\
When everything is accepted as it is,\
the mind becomes silent.

The door of total acceptance opens,\
and through it, the ocean of peace and silence enters within.

Pause

Recognise this experience of suchness.\
It is the soul and essence of meditation.

The deepest experiences of meditation contain suchness,\
the complete acceptance of what is, as it is.

Recognise this state of total acceptance.\
Feel it. Understand it clearly.\
Make this distinction in your consciousness.

This is the centre of meditation, the very heart of it.\
When everything is accepted, the mind is silent.\
The mind is empty.

There is no opposition to the world.\
We accept the world as it is.

We are part of the world,\
So why resist it, why fight, why stand in enmity?

When resistance ends,\
the life that is within you meets the life that is outside you.

Understand this experience deeply\
and then move to the final step of meditation.

### Dissolution into Witnessing

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Tone_rose-gold_luminous_Scene_.jpeg" alt="" width="384"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

\[Soft background: faint breeze, distant temple bell, low drone or silence]

Close your eyes and relax. (short pause)\

Relax it so deeply that it feels as if there is no body at all. (medium pause)

Now imagine that all the energy spread throughout the body is returning inward. (short pause)\
We are coming back from the body. (short pause)\
Gather all the energy that has been scattered across the body and bring it inside. (medium pause)\
Call all your energy home, inside. (medium pause)

For the next three minutes, I will suggest: the body is getting relaxed… the body is getting relaxed.\
Experience this. (short pause)\
With each suggestion, let go a little more. (short pause)\
Slowly, you will feel the body is gone. (medium pause)

And when the body starts to fall, do not stop it. (short pause)\
Let go.\
If it falls forward, let it fall forward. (short pause)\
If it falls backward, let it fall backward. (medium pause)

Release all control of the body. (short pause)\
Drop every hold you have on it. (medium pause)

This is the first step. (short pause)\
For three minutes, we relax the body.\
Then, the breath.\
Then, the thoughts. (short pause)\
And finally, we dissolve into silence for ten minutes. (medium pause)

Now… experience that the body is getting relaxed.\
The body is getting relaxed. (soft repetition, slower each time)\
The body is getting relaxed… (short pause)\
The body is getting relaxed. (medium pause)

Let go as if there is no body at all. (short pause)\
Leave every hold you have. (short pause)\
The body is getting relaxed. (soft repetition)\
Completely relaxed. (short pause)

Leave all the energy that’s holding the body —\
as if the body is dead. (short pause)\
We have moved inside. (medium pause)

The body has become hollow. (short pause)\
The body is relaxed… relaxed… relaxed. (soft repetition)\
Completely relaxed. (medium pause)

Soon you will feel, the body is gone.\
It’s gone. (soft pause)\
The body has disappeared. (short pause)\
If it wants to fall, let it fall. (short pause)\
The body is completely relaxed.\
As if it is dead.\
As if it no longer exists. (medium pause)

\[soft silence 20–30 seconds]

Now, relax the breath. (short pause)\
The breath is becoming calm. (soft tone)\
Breathing is becoming calm. (short pause)\
Experience this calmness. (short pause)\
The breath is calm… calm… calm. (soft repetition)\
Let go. Leave the body and the breath. (medium pause)\
The breath has become completely calm. (long pause)

Now, thoughts are getting calm. (short pause)\
Thoughts are getting calm. (soft repetition)\
Feel this calmness spreading through the mind. (medium pause)\
Thoughts are quiet… still… fading away. (medium pause)

The body is relaxed.\
The breath is calm.\
The thoughts are still. (medium pause)\
Everything has become empty inside. (short pause)

You are falling into this emptiness. (softly)\
Falling deeper… and deeper… (slow repetition)\
Like someone falling into a deep well, without end. (medium pause)\
Falling down… and down… into the emptiness. (long pause)

Leave yourself completely. (short pause)\
If there is any hold, drop it. (short pause)\
Dive deep into the emptiness. (medium pause)\
Go deep… deep… deep. (soft repetition)

Only consciousness remains,\
like a small flame burning within. (short pause)\
It is watching. It is knowing. (medium pause)\
Just the witness remains. (short pause)\
Now keep witnessing. (short pause)\
Keep watching inside. (medium pause)

Everything outside is dead. (short pause)\
The body is dead. (short pause)\
The breath is still. (short pause)\
The thoughts have stopped. (medium pause)\
We are falling inward, just watching. (medium pause)

Keep watching… and watching. (softly)\
And as you watch, a deeper peace appears. (medium pause)\
A greater emptiness opens. (long pause)

Keep watching.\
By watching, “I” disappears, and only light remains. (long pause)

Now I will be silent for ten minutes.\
You go inside. (short pause)\
Let go of everything.\
Release every hold. (medium pause)\
Remain only as the witness. (long pause, ten minutes of silence)

\[After 10 minutes, soft background fades back in]

The mind is becoming quieter and calmer. (short pause)\
Keep watching. (short pause)\
Only watching remains inside. (medium pause)\
The body now feels far away, as if it belongs to someone else. (short pause)\
You have moved away from the body. (medium pause)\
The breath too feels distant, as if someone else is breathing. (long pause)

Move deeper inside. (short pause)\
Deeper and deeper. (soft repetition)\
Keep watching. (medium pause)\
The mind enters complete emptiness. (medium pause)

Mind is getting quieter… quieter… (soft tone)\
Deeper still. (short pause)\
Keep watching within. (medium pause)\
Now the mind is completely quiet. (long pause)

The body is far behind,\
like it has been left behind in another world. (short pause)\
Let go completely. (short pause)\
As if you are completely dead, without any hold. (medium pause)\
Mind is becoming empty… empty… (soft repetition)

The body has been left completely. (short pause)\
Look at it, lying far away. (medium pause)\
You have come far from it. (short pause)

The mind is completely silent. (medium pause)

Look inside. (short pause)\
Feel, I have disappeared. I have been erased. (short pause)\
“I” is gone. (short pause)\
Only consciousness remains. (short pause)\
Only knowing remains. (long pause)\
Everything else has disappeared. (medium pause)

Now slowly, take a few deep, long, slow, rhythmic breaths. (softly)\
The mind is silent. (short pause)\
Take a few more deep breaths. (medium pause)\
Watch every breath. (short pause)\
You will see the mind becoming calmer still. (medium pause)

Breathe slowly. (short pause)\
Watch each breath as it moves. (short pause)\
See how distant the breath feels,\
as if it is something separate from you. (medium pause)

Take a few more deep breaths slowly. (long pause)

Now, open your eyes slowly. (soft tone)\
Very slowly. (short pause)\
Do not hurry. (medium pause)

If your eyes do not open easily,\
take a few more deep breaths,\
and then open them gently. (medium pause)

Now, simply look outside for a moment. (short pause)\
Do not move.\
Just look. (medium pause)

Stay still.\
Watch quietly. (long pause)
