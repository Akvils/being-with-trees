# 🏞️ I: Initiation

Every journey begins with intention. And here, we make the first distinction: when we step outside our home, where are we truly going?

We can enter the human world, a place bound by rules, complexity, programs, and noise. Here we often feel disconnected, heavy, and judged. This is the 3D material world. Or we can choose to enter the natural world,  where there are trees, birds, rivers, and skies that carry no judgment, no programs, only presence. This is the astral, heart-centred world. After all, it is green.

This distinction first became clear to me many years ago in India, during a time of deep confusion. I was living in a university hostel, going through what I now recognise as a spiritual awakening. Outside my window stood a mango tree. I used to sit with it, silently, seeking some kind of relief.

On 12 December 2012 (12:12:12), the day Mayans said the world would end, it truly did for me. That evening, there was a festival on campus. I went outside and watched the people around me. They were shouting, laughing, crying, all acting through their programs, caught in their egos. From my state of emptiness and questioning, I could see how chaotic and heavy it all was.

I felt no desire to join them. Instead, I returned to my mango tree. And there I realised: the human world felt exhausting, almost toxic, while the natural world felt calm, connected, and home.

That was the first time I made the choice: not to live in the heavy human world, but to live in the natural world. Among the trees, among the birds, where things simply are.

This is where the journey begins, with intention and with the choice of which world to enter. When you make that choice, you move from the material world to the ethereal one.
