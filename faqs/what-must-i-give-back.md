# 💰 What must I give back?

#### On the Law of Exchange

When we begin to receive from the trees, calm, warmth, or clarity, the mind immediately asks: What must I give back?\
It is a human question, born from the habit of transaction. We have built entire worlds upon the belief that everything must be traded, that even love must be earned.

But the trees do not trade. They give because giving is their nature. They do not keep accounts, nor measure what they offer. Their generosity is effortless, as breathing is to us when we are at peace.

And so, when we receive from them, we are not asked for payment, only for sincerity.

We might think, But what do I have to give?\
Imagine a beggar invited to a great feast by a rich man who wishes only to share his abundance. The beggar has nothing to offer in return, except gratitude. Yet that simple, sincere thank you completes the circle. Love does not need to be balanced. It only needs to be acknowledged.

When we light an incense stick for a tree, when we touch its bark gently, when we bow in silence, these are not transactions. They are gestures of recognition. They are the ways by which we say, I see you. I remember.

The law of exchange in nature is not based on equality of value, but on harmony of intention.\
To receive fully and to give thanks wholly, that is enough.\
The energy returns by itself, completing a loop that has no beginning and no end.

When we understand this, the relationship between human and tree changes.\
It is no longer about taking or giving. It becomes participation.\
It becomes love.

#### Bridge: Entering the Communion

These insights form the foundation of how we approach the trees.\
Before we meet them, we must remember that this is not an exchange between equals, nor a ritual of worship, but a communion, an act of recognition between living presences. The trees are not objects of our practice; they are our elders, our kin, and our mirrors.

When we walk toward them, we walk into a relationship.\
They have been here long before us, and they will remain long after. Their silence is not absence, but awareness, patient, immense, and full of memory. To stand before a tree is to stand before the living history of the Earth herself.

So when we enter their presence, we begin not by asking or expecting, but by softening. We breathe, we listen, and we let the restless human need for purpose dissolve. The connection happens naturally, as it always has, when love meets love, without condition.
