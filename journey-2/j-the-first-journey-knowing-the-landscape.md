# ⛰️ J: The First Journey: Knowing the Landscape

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/j1 Know Your Environment.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The journeys in this program are designed to unfold step by step, beginning outward, with the world around us, and gradually moving inward, into subtler and deeper layers of experience. Each journey is an exploration, and together they form a path.

We begin in Vilnius, Lithuania, in Bernardino Sodas, a park that will serve as the landscape of our first practice. This place is both ordinary and extraordinary, a living ecosystem where nature, trees, people, and energy flow together.

The first journey is about getting to know your environment, your park, your forest, your city’s green space. It is about learning to move through different levels of energy in harmony with nature.

To guide this, we draw on the energetic system of the East: the seven energy centers of the human body, or chakras. Each chakra carries a particular desire, a particular vibration, and by consciously engaging with them, we learn to ascend, step by step.

At the beginning, it is best to follow the structure as designed. Later, once you have learned the distinctions and absorbed the basics, you can shape your own journeys freely, weaving your own rhythm, your own practices, and your own dialogue with nature.

#### The Seven Levels of the First Journey

1\. **Muladhara (Root Chakra)**: the desire for food, sleep, and survival.\
At this stage we simply ground ourselves. Feel your body, notice hunger or tiredness, acknowledge the simple human needs. In ancient language, this is the tamasic state, heavy, sluggish, bound to instinct.

2\. **Swadhisthana (Sacral Chakra)**: the desire for pleasure and enjoyment.\
Here we recognize how much of society vibrates at this level, seeking comfort, pleasure, distraction. Notice it, without judgment. This awareness prepares us to move forward.

3\. **Manipura (Solar Plexus Chakra)**: the desire for power, money, and recognition.\
This is the fire of action. To awaken it, we move the body: cardio, running, push-ups, pull-ups. Wake the organism, stir its vitality. This is the rajasic state, active, striving, outward.

4\. **Anahata (Heart Chakra)**: the desire for love.\
Now we open into connection. This is the moment to meet the trees, to give and receive love. Hug a tree, feed and pet a dog, share kindness with a friend. Notice how love transforms the energy around you.

5\. **Vishuddhi (Throat Chakra)**: the desire for self-expression and knowledge.\
Here we speak, we communicate, we create dialogue. Talk with a friend, talk to the trees, express yourself openly. The act of speaking and listening refines awareness and brings clarity.

6\. **Ajna (Third Eye Chakra)**: the desire to think, to understand, to perceive.\
Now we enter the domain of the mind. Play games that sharpen the intellect, chess, puzzles, strategy. Then move into meditation. Focus the mind, open the inner vision.

7\. **Sahasrara (Crown Chakra)**: the desire to simply exist, to merge into unity.\
At this highest level, we dissolve into presence. Ask deep questions, reflect on philosophy, meditate with focus at the third eye until all distinctions fade. This is sattva, clarity, harmony, peace.

#### The Path Forward

For this first journey, we emphasize the physical and outward exercises, getting to know your environment, your body, your energy. Later, as we progress, the journeys will guide you into subtler practices: meeting the trees directly, entering deeper meditation, dissolving into unity.

But for now: follow the steps, explore your environment, and allow yourself to be with nature, in nature, as part of this vast artwork that surrounds us.
