#### Part 1: Sitting Posture and Preparation

Sit down. You can sit on a chair with your feet together on the floor.

It is better to sit cross-legged on a pillow, in the Eastern style. If you can, you may sit in the lotus posture.

Sit erect. Your back must be straight. Hold it straight, but do not be rigid. Don’t lull, because you might fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we go into our subconscious. We are trying to enter the subconscious consciously, so you must remain awake and alert.

You can put your hands by your side. Or you can sit with your hands locked in Dhyan Mudra or the Meditation Gesture. This hand gesture helps with deep focus. It is a sacred hand position formed by resting the right hand over the left in the lap, palms up, with the thumbs touching to create a triangle or oval.

To create this gesture:

1. Place your left hand in your lap with the palm facing up. Then, place your right hand on top of your left, also with the palm facing up.
2. Gently touch the tips of your thumbs together. This will form a small triangle or oval shape.
3. Keep your fingers extended and relaxed.

You are sitting in an upright posture. Now, close your eyes. Use an eye mask if you want to. This will help to block out external distractions.

#### Part 2: The Smile

As you settle into this posture with closed eyes, a smile may come naturally.

If not, bring a subtle smile to your face.

This is not a wide or social grin. It should be a slight, serene expression, like the smile on a Buddha statue.

Focus on the physical sensation of this action at the corners of your mouth. Allow the feeling to relax your jaw, your cheeks, and the muscles around your eyes.

This is an internal adjustment. Holding this specific facial posture changes the inner chemistry.

Maintain this smile.

Follow these instructions simply and without effort. No concentration is necessary at this stage. Simply do what is asked.

#### Part 3: Inner Attention

Pay attention. Just as your attention is effortlessly drawn to the sound of my voice, you will now turn this same attention inward.

Look at your eyelids. What do you see? You may see little twinkles of light, different shapes moving across the screen of your mind. You are not going to sleep; you are going to be fully aware. Just look and try this.

Keep your mind on those little twinkling lights, those dots with all the different colors and sparkles moving across the screen of your mind. Just be aware of them.

If you do this, you will find you are in a refuge. You can hear my voice, but you have left your thoughts behind. You are separate from your thinking. Your thoughts cannot bother you here. Because your mind is not caught up in thoughts, your consciousness becomes pure. Do not try to understand this.

Now, from here, focus this attention on the third eye, the point between your eyebrows. You are looking at the back of the eyelids and a bit up. Take your time and relax.

As you focus on this point, you might notice a grainy mass of black and light pinpoints. Keep your mind centered on that point and allow yourself to settle into it. If you are new to meditation, keep practicing and you will gradually find it easier to focus there. If you are a natural meditator, your attention may lock in, and you might feel an intense release of tension or lightness. Always start with the third eye and collect yourself there. Do not worry if you cannot find it at first; it will come with practice.

#### Part 4: Learning to Breathe

You are sitting with your back straight and your eyes closed. Follow these breathing instructions.

This technique is for slow, long, deep, rhythmic breaths that reach the belly. It is known as diaphragmatic breathing, which is what babies do naturally and can help reduce anxiety. These breaths are a sign of samadhi, and it is important to learn this technique to help you achieve that state.

Let us begin.

First, breathe out completely and empty your lungs. This ensures you do not breathe in any old air.

Now, breathe in slowly, filling up your belly without using your chest. Stop as soon as your chest starts to rise.\
Hold your breath for a few seconds.\
Then, breathe out slowly, as slowly as possible, emptying your lungs completely.

Let's practice this together for three breaths, trying to make them as rhythmic as possible.

Now, we will add a refinement. When you breathe in, push the air down with the muscles in the back of your belly. This is similar to how women bear down during childbirth.

Let's try a full belly breath for practice.\
First, empty your lungs completely.\
Breathe into your belly without letting your chest rise, pushing down with your muscles.\
Hold your breath for 3-5 seconds.\
Then, slowly breathe out.

When you start, you might find you can't hold your breath for very long, but that will improve over time. By filling your belly and bearing down, you open up the lower part of your lungs, which helps your respiratory system and oxygenates your blood. Some people might feel a bit dizzy from the extra oxygen; this is normal.

Remember not to force anything. Do not distress your body. Moderation is best. Easy is best.

Breathing like this will quiet your body. When the mind is tense, it causes quick, shallow breaths, leading to a shortage of oxygen and restlessness in the mind and body. This practice counteracts that.

Let's do a few more belly breaths together.

Breathe out, emptying your lungs.\
Breathe in slowly, stopping as your chest begins to rise.\
Hold your breath. Push down with your belly muscles for 3-5 seconds.\
Release your breath as slowly as you can.

Again. Breathe out, empty.\
In slowly. Stop as the chest begins to rise.\
Hold. Push down.\
Breathe out, release as slowly as you can.

Again. Out. In slowly. Hold. Push down. Out slowly. Good.

Remember to breathe from your diaphragm every 3-5 minutes while meditating. Distractions from thoughts are a good sign that you need to take these breaths.

As you breathe, notice if the breath is coming from the left side or the right. Keep breathing.

#### Part 5: Understanding Hurt and Healing

Human beings are hurt. Human beings are hurt from childhood; you are hurt. If you see that as an actuality, that the very essence of you is hurt, what will you do about it?

The "you" that is hurt is the image you have about yourself. The process of thought is hurt. From that arises anger and resistance. You withdraw, and the more you are inwardly separate, withdrawing, the more you are hurt. So you build a wall around yourself.

It is only when there is inattention that the registration of hurt takes place. Attention is like a flame that burns out the past and the present. At the moment of a potential hurt, if you are aware and give your total attention, no registration takes place.

Now, think of how an animal heals. Imagine a wounded deer lying in a cave. A leopard wounded him badly, but he escaped. Now, in the cave, the deer is hurt. He just lies down and breathes. Breathing is happening; he is not consciously doing it. He is not trying to concentrate, eat, or drink. He is just lying there, hurt, breathing, watching the breath with equanimity. He is not reacting, not screaming in pain, not crying over the story of what happened. He just lies there, watching the breath. This is when healing happens.

So, let's just do that. This will make more sense when the hurt that society has given you comes up as we progress in our meditation.

#### Part 6: Anapanasati - Unified Breath Awareness

We will now practice what the wounded deer knows. We will observe the breath with equanimity.

First, anchor your perspective. Settle your awareness in the middle of your forehead, the third eye. From this vantage point, as if you are looking down from that space, bring your attention to the entrance of your nostrils. Your base of awareness is the forehead; the object of your observation is the breath at the nose. Distribute your awareness between these two points.

(Pause)

Now, from the middle of your forehead, start observing your own natural, normal breath as it comes in and as it goes out at the nostrils.

Your only job is to feel the sensation of your own natural breath as it enters and leaves your nostrils. Just awareness. Nothing else.

(Short pause)

If the breath is deep, be aware: "it is deep." If it is shallow, be aware: "it is shallow." Do not try to change it or regulate it. The breath might be long or short; it doesn't matter. You are just an observer watching from your command post.

As the breath comes in, it touches the entrance of the nostrils. From your vantage point, feel that touch. As the breath goes out, it touches the entrance of the nostrils. Feel that touch.

(Pause)

You are not to add any word or name. No mantra. No visualization. Just the bare reality of the breath as it is.

Your mind will wander. When a thought comes, do this: shift your awareness from the breath at the nostrils up to the inner sky, the space between the eyebrows where your awareness is based. Watch that space until the thought passes. Then, once it is gone, gently guide your attention back down to the primary task: observing the sensation of the breath at your nostrils.

Again and again, when a thought arises, shift to the inner sky. Then, return to the breath.

(Short pause)

As you continue to observe, you will notice more.\
From your vantage point, is the breath coming in from the left nostril? The right nostril? Or both nostrils simultaneously? Just observe.\
You may notice the temperature. The incoming breath may feel slightly cool, and the outgoing breath may feel slightly warm. If you feel it, just be aware of it. If you don't, that is also fine. Just stay with the most predominant sensation at the nostrils.

The task is simple, but not easy. Simply watch.

(Silence for 5-10 minutes for practice)

Continue to be aware of the sensation of the breath. Every breath. From the moment it begins to enter until it has fully entered. From the moment it begins to go out until it has fully gone out. All observed from the middle of the forehead.

Stay with the reality of this present moment. The breath is the reality of this moment.

(Silence for 5-10 minutes for practice)

Keep your attention fixed. Your perspective is the forehead; your object is the breath. Sharp. Focused. Aware. This practice sharpens the mind and trains it to remain in the present.

(Short pause)

Now, for the last few moments, continue the practice with all the diligence you can. Aware of every breath.

(Silence for 2 minutes for practice)

#### Part 7: Conclusion

Now, release the focus from the breath. Let your awareness withdraw from the middle of your forehead. Allow your breath to return to its own natural, spontaneous rhythm.

Become aware of your physical body. Feel the weight of your body on the chair or cushion. Feel the points of contact it makes. Notice the sensation of the air on your skin.

When you are ready, you can introduce some gentle movement. You might wiggle your fingers and your toes.

Then, in your own time, when you feel ready and not before, slowly and gently open your eyes.

Take a moment. Observe how you feel. Carry this state of quiet awareness with you as you move into the rest of your day.
