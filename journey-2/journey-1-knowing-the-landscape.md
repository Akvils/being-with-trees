# ⛰️ Journey 1: Knowing the Landscape

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/j1 Know Your Environment.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The journeys in this program are designed to unfold step by step, beginning outward, with the world around us, and gradually moving inward, into subtler and deeper layers of experience. Each journey is an exploration, and together they form a path.

We begin in Vilnius, Lithuania, in Bernardino Sodas, a park that will serve as the landscape of our first practice. This place is both ordinary and extraordinary, a living ecosystem where nature, trees, people, and energy flow together.

We invite you to find a similar setting that is accessible to you. This could be your own local park, a city green space, or any patch of nature you can return to.

The first journey is about getting to know your environment, your park, your forest, your city’s green space. It is about learning to move through different levels of energy in harmony with nature.

This first journey is about getting to know this environment. Take the time to truly explore it, as this space will become your sanctuary and your healing space. This is the ground where you will later learn to meditate deeply, to meet the spirit of nature, and to journey into yourself and beyond.&#x20;

**A Map for the Journey**

As a guide for our walk, we will draw inspiration from the energetic system of the seven energy centers of the human body. Each invitation corresponds to one of these centers, carrying a particular desire and vibration. By consciously engaging with them one by one, we learn to walk a path of ascent from body to spirit.

At the beginning, it is best to follow the structure as designed. Later, once you have learned the distinctions and absorbed the basics, you can shape your own journeys freely, weaving your own rhythm, your own practices, and your own dialogue with nature.

#### The First Invitation: The Root, Desire for Survival

As you take your first steps into the park, this initial invitation is simply to come home to your body. Its theme is **Survival**, and its energy center is the Root, or Muladhara.

This is a practice of **grounding**.

Feel your feet on the path. Notice the solid earth beneath you, holding you up with every step. Bring your attention fully into your physical body.

Ask yourself simple, honest questions.\
Are you hungry?\
Are you horny?\
Are you tired?\
Do you feel warm, or do you feel a chill?

#### The Second Invitation: The Sacral, Desire for Pleasure

Having grounded yourself in the body, we now gently lift our awareness. This invitation is about **Pleasure**, and its energy center is the Sacral, or Swadhisthana.

This is a practice of **observation**.

As you continue your walk, open your senses to the world of enjoyment around you.

Notice the sound of friends laughing on a bench.\
See a couple walking hand-in-hand.\
Observe the simple pleasure of someone relaxing in the sun, or the taste of a cold drink on a warm day.

Recognise how much of our human world vibrates at this level, the constant, natural search for comfort, for pleasure, for gentle distraction.

Your task here is not to judge it as good or bad. Simply see it. Acknowledge this powerful current of energy that flows through all of us. By seeing this level of desire clearly and without judgment, you prepare yourself to consciously move to the next.

#### The Third Invitation: The Solar Plexus, Desire for Power and Action

From the quiet observation of pleasure, we now move to ignite our own inner fire. This invitation is about **Power and Action**, and its energy center is the Solar Plexus, or Manipura.

This is a practice of **Activation**.

It is time to awaken your own vitality. Find a space within the park where you can move your body with intention. This can be through a short burst of cardio, a brisk run between two trees, a set of push-ups, or any vigorous activity that stirs your energy.

The purpose is to wake up the organism, to feel the power in your muscles and the strength in your breath.

This is the state known as rajas, the energy of action, of striving, of outward expression. You are no longer just observing; you are participating. You are alive and full of fire.

#### The Fourth Invitation: The Heart, Desire for Love

With your energy awakened and your fire lit, we now move from the self to the other. This invitation is about **Love**, and its energy center is the Heart, or Anahata.

This is a practice of **Connection**.

It is time to meet the world from your heart space. Let your gaze soften and your attention expand to the living beings around you.

* **Meet a Tree**: Approach a tree that calls to you. Place a hand on its bark, or, if you feel comfortable, give it a hug. Feel its steady, patient, and unconditional presence. Offer it your gratitude.
* **Meet an Animal**: If there is a friendly dog nearby, ask its owner if you can greet it. Kneel down and share a moment of simple, joyful affection.
* **Meet a Person**: If you are with a friend, turn to them and share a moment of genuine appreciation. If you are alone, offer a warm, silent blessing to a stranger you pass by.

Notice how the simple act of giving and receiving love transforms your energy. Feel the shift from the fiery action of the Solar Plexus to the warm, radiant glow of the Heart. This is where healing begins.

#### The Fifth Invitation: The Throat, Desire for Expression

From the silent connection of the heart, we now move to give our experience a voice. This invitation is about **Self-Expression**, and its energy center is the Throat, or Vishuddhi.

This is a practice of **Dialogue**.

It is time to externalise what you have been feeling internally.

* If you are with a friend, this is the moment to share. Talk about what you have noticed in the park, what you felt during the previous steps, or how it felt to connect with the tree. Practice both speaking your truth and listening with presence.
* If you are alone, do not let that stop you. Speak to the trees, even in a whisper. Describe what you see, what you feel. Articulate a thought that has been circling in your mind. Or, sing a song. Be free and express yourself.

The act of forming your experience into words refines your awareness. It brings clarity to your thoughts and gives shape to your feelings, bridging the gap between your inner world and the outer world.

#### The Sixth Invitation: The Third Eye, Desire to Perceive

Having connected with your heart and given voice to your experience, we now arrive at the central pillar of this journey. This invitation is about mastering **Perception**, and its energy center is the Third Eye, or Ajna.

This is the time for formal practice. The practice of **Focus**.

Find a quiet place within your sanctuary park. Choose a spot that feels right to you, perhaps at the base of a large, steady tree, or on a secluded bench where you will not be disturbed. This will be your temple for the next hour.

Settle into your posture. Here, you will begin the **Inner Refuge meditation** that is associated with this journey. This is the core practice where you will build your inner sanctuary by mastering your attention and your breath.

The meditation will guide you through its specific stages:

* Establishing posture and a gentle smile.
* Focusing your attention on the inner screen of your mind.
* Learning the art of conscious breathing.
* And finally, entering the deep, unifying practice of breath awareness.

When you are settled in your chosen spot, you may now begin the Inner Refuge meditation.

#### The Seventh Invitation: The Crown, Desire to Exist

After completing the Inner Refuge meditation, as you sit in the profound state of peace it creates, you may feel called to deepen your practice with one final invitation. This is about **Unity**, and its energy centre is the Crown, or Sahasrara. At this highest level, the desire is to simply exist, to merge into pure being, transcending all form.

This is a practice of **Merging**.

With your mind calm and your breath unified, you can now introduce a profound question into your awareness. Ask silently, "Who am I?"

Do not search for an answer with your mind. Do not look for words or labels. Let the question itself be a tool that dissolves the sense of a separate "you." Let the observer and the observed begin to fade into one another, resting in the state of pure clarity, harmony, and peace.

Remain in this state of quiet inquiry and presence for as long as you feel drawn to, experiencing yourself not as a person in a park, but as consciousness itself.

When you feel complete, take a final, deep breath. Let the boundaries of your body gently reform, but carry this feeling of spaciousness and unity with you. You are ready to return, bringing a taste of the infinite back into the world of form.

#### The Path Forward

As you rise and bring your journey to a close, know that you have now completed this Journey. You have explored your sanctuary, activated your energy, and built your inner refuge. You have laid the foundation.

The skills of presence and deep focus you have cultivated here are the tools you will use to go deeper.

In the next journey, we will move beyond simply observing nature and begin to truly merge our senses with it. We will also learn to go deeper into meditation and awareness.<br>
