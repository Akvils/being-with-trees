After you have practised meeting trees for some time, something deeper may begin to happen.

Take a walk in nature, ideally in a forest or your typical space for this course, to attune yourself more closely to the spirits of the living world.\
Go without expectation. Do not imagine what you hope to find before you begin.\
Simply set your intention for healing and go.

Do not try to connect with a particular kind of tree or plant.\
Instead, enter a sensitive, receptive state of mind and allow the tree to choose you.\
As you walk, become aware that you are surrounded not only by the visible world, but also by an invisible one, an extraordinary reality that lies just beyond your physical senses.\
Everything around you is alive, an expression of the Great Spirit’s consciousness.\
These beings experience life differently from you, but they are aware of their existence.

Let your feet lead you where they wish.\
Pause often.\
Observe, listen, and absorb the atmosphere of the forest.\
Continue walking until you feel drawn toward a particular tree.\
Perhaps its scent calls to you, or the movement of a branch in the wind catches your attention.\
When this happens, know that the tree has responded to your spirit and made itself known to you.

Go to the tree and embrace it.\
Touch its bark, hold it close, and let your heart open.\
Speak to it softly, tell the tree that you love and admire it, that you wish it well, and that you seek its help.\
Explain that you wish to understand its true nature.

This practice is a step beyond the earlier exercise of sensing a tree’s aura and receiving its energy.\
Here, you are entering a deeper exchange, an attempt to perceive the tree’s inner reality, which is more than its outer form.

As you hold the tree, you may wish to rest your forehead against the trunk.\
When the spirit of the tree begins to communicate with your spirit, you may hear its words through your inner ear, or see its messages through the inner eye at your brow.\
Remain calm and alert.\
Let the experience arise naturally, do not imagine or invent it.\
True contact happens in stillness.

Before leaving, ask the tree’s spirit for permission to take a small part of it with you, to serve as an ally in your future work.\
Wait patiently for intuitive guidance; the tree will show you what it offers.\
Depending on its kind, you may be guided to take a leaf, a cone, a nut, or a flower.\
If the tree allows you to take a twig or a small branch, touch a bit of your saliva to the place where you cut, it is a sign of respect and healing.

Thank the tree for what it has given you, and offer something in return.\
Sprinkle a little flour, sugar, or a blend of dried herbs at its base.\
These small gestures symbolise the sacred exchange of energies between you.

Do not concern yourself with what others may think of your actions, and keep this experience private.\
Many people do not yet understand that trees and plants can communicate with us.\
But you know they can, and you have learned how to listen.

Now that you have met your tree and felt its spirit, sit quietly under its branches.\
Rest your back against its trunk and let your breath slow.\
Allow the connection you’ve created to carry you into stillness.\
Begin your meditation there, held in the quiet awareness of the tree.
