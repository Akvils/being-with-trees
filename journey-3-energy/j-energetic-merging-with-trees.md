Now that you have learned to sense and commune with trees, you are ready to move among them more freely.\
This time, do not focus on one tree alone. Walk gently through the forest and meet many of them, ten, fifteen, or however many call to you.

Approach each tree with love.\
See it, acknowledge it, and send your love toward it.\
As you do, feel the tree responding, returning love to you in its quiet, ancient way.

Walk slowly and stay relaxed.\
As you come near, allow your aura to blend with the tree’s.\
Feel her energy and let yours flow freely with it, no effort, no control.\
Be open, receptive, and soft.

Imagine your chakras aligning and merging with the energy field of the tree,\
beginning at your root, rising through your body, to the crown and beyond.\
Let your breath move with the rhythm of this connection.\
If you feel called, wrap your arms around her trunk.\
Embrace her as an equal, as kin.

When the exchange feels complete, thank her quietly.\
Then move on to the next tree and repeat the meeting.\
Let it become a gentle dance between you and the forest,\
a rhythm of approach, connection, gratitude, and release.

By the time you have met ten or fifteen trees, you will feel renewed,\
your body light, your energy clear, your mind still.\
One tree among them will feel different, familiar, inviting.\
That is the tree meant for you. Sit beneath it.\
This will be your tree for meditation.

From now on, in every journey, find your tree before you begin.\
Sit under its branches, merge with its stillness,\
and let your meditation deepen through its strength and wisdom.\
The trees will become your teachers, steady, ancient, and alive.
