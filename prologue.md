> Two friends were walking through a street in Vilnius.\
> One of them suddenly stopped, bent down, and picked something up from the pavement.\
> The moment he looked at it, his whole face lit up. He was glowing, almost shaking with joy.
>
> His friend stared at him and said,\
> “What did you find? Why do you look so happy?”
>
> The man held the small thing in his hand and said,\
> “I picked up truth.”
>
> His friend said,\
> “Wonderful. Let’s go organise it.”
